{"text": "  Because the FE exam uses both SI units and U.S. Customary System (USCS) \nunits, USCS units are introduced in Chapter 1 and then utilized in numerous example \nproblems as well as the FE exam formatted problems. A conversion factor table is presented in Appendix C.  \n  The concept of materials and energy balance as a tool for understanding environ-\nmental processes and solving environmental engineering problems is carried through the text. This concept is introduced in a stand-alone chapter and then applied for con-servative systems in hydrology (hydrologic cycle, development of the rational for-mula, and reservoir design). This theme is expanded to include sludge mass balance in water treatment (Chapter 6), and the DO sag curve in Chapter 7. The design equations for a completely mixed activated sludge system and a more elaborate sludge mass bal-ance are developed in Chapter 8. Mass balance is used to account for the production of sulfur dioxide from the combustion of coal and in the development of absorber design equations in Chapter 9. In Chapter 12, a mass balance approach is used for waste audit. There are over 100 materials and energy balance end-of-chapter problems spread throughout the text.  \n  Each chapter concludes with a list of review items, the traditional end-of-chapter \nproblems, and, perhaps less traditional, discussion questions and FE formatted prob-lems. The review items have been written in the \u201cobjective\u201d format of the Accredita-tion Board for Engineering"}

Instructors will find this particularly helpful for directing student review for exams, for assessing continuous quality improvement for ABET, and for preparing documentation for ABET curricu-lum review. We have found the discussion questions useful as a \u201cminute check\u201d or spot quiz item to see if the students understand concepts as well as number crunching.  \n  The fifth edition has been thoroughly revised and updated. With the addition of \n58 new end-of-chapter problems, there are now a total of over 720 problems. Sixty-six of the problems have been set up for spreadsheet solutions. Two   Solver  \u00ae   example \nproblems are demonstrated in Chapter 8.  \n  When the senior author was teaching, the course bearing the title of this book pro-\nvided the foundation for four follow-on senior-level environmental engineering courses. The initial portions of selected chapters (materials and energy balances, water resource engineering, water treatment, water pollution, wastewater treatment, air pollution, noise pollution, and solid waste) were included in the introductory course. Advanced material, including most of the design concepts, were covered in the upper-level courses (water resources engineering, water and wastewater treatment plant design, solid and hazardous waste management). Some of the material is left for the students to pursue on their own (environmental legislation, ionizing radiation). This book provides an ideal foundation for the senior author\u2019s "}

These include the provision of safe, palatable, and ample public water supplies; the proper disposal of or recycle of wastewater and solid wastes; the adequate drainage of urban and rural areas for proper sanitation; and the control of water, soil, and atmospheric pollution, and the social and environmental impact of these solutions. Furthermore it is concerned with engineering problems in the field of public health, such as control of arthropod-borne diseases, the elimination of industrial health hazards, and the provision of adequate sanitation in urban, rural, and recre-ational areas, and the effect of technological advances on the environment (ASCE, 1973, 1977). Environmental engineering is not concerned primarily with heating, ventilating, or air conditioning (HV AC), nor is it concerned primarily with landscape architec-ture. Neither should it be confused with the architectural and structural engineering functions associated with built environments, such as homes, offices, and o"}
{"text": "ther workplaces. Historically, environmental engineering has been a specialty area of civil engineer-ing. Today it is still primarily associated with civil engineering in academic curricula. However, especially at the graduate level, students may come from a multitude of other disciplines, such as chemical, bio-systems, electrical, and mechanical engineering as well as biochemistry, microbiology, and soil science.\nProfessional Development\nThe beginning of professional development for environmental engineers is the suc-cessful attainment of the baccalaureate degree. For continued development, a degree in engineering from a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) provides a firm foundation for professional growth.

In addition we note that we \nhave made a special effort to flag equations that appear in the NCEES FE Fundamen-tals of Engineering Supplied-Reference Handbook.\nProfessions\nEnvironmental engineers are professionals. Being a professional is more than being in or of a profession. True professionals are those who pursue their learned art in a spirit of public service (ASCE, 1973). True professionalism is defined by the follow-ing characteristics:\n 1. Professional decisions are made by means of general principles, theories, or \npropositions that are independent of the particular case under consideration.\n 2. Professional decisions imply knowledge in a specific area in which the person \nis expert. The professional is an expert only in his or her profession and not an \nexpert at everything.\n 3. The professional\u2019s relati"}
{"text": "ons with his or her clients are objective and indepen-\ndent of particular sentiments about them.\n 4. A professional achieves status and financial reward by accomplishment, not \nby inherent qualities such as birth order, race, religion, sex, or age or by mem-bership in a union.\n 5. A professional\u2019s decisions are assumed to be on behalf of the client and to be \nindependent of self-interest.\n 6. The professional relates to a voluntary association of professionals and \naccepts only the authority of those colleagues as a sanction on his or her own behavior (Schein, 1968).\n A professional\u2019s superior knowledge is recognized. This puts the client into a very vulnerable position. The client retains significant authority and responsibility for deci-sion making. The professional supplies ideas and information and proposes courses of action. The client\u2019s judgment and consent are required. The client\u2019s vulnerability has necessitated the development of a strong professional code of ethics. The code of eth-ics serves to protect not only the client but the public. Codes of ethics are enforced through the professional\u2019s peer group.\n1-2 PROFESSIONAL CODES OF ETHICS\nCivil engineering, from which environmental engineering is primarily, but not exclu-sively, derived, has an established code of ethics that embodies these principles. The code is summarized in Figure 1-1. The FE Fundamentals of Engineering Supplied-\nReference Handbook, published by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering a"}

Although it seems a bit unrealistic for us to set a framework for a discussion of environmental ethics in this short introduction, we have summarized a few salient points in Table 1-1.FIGURE 1-1 \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers code \nof ethics.

Here is an example for each of the principles listed:\n \u2022 The first principle may be threatened when it comes into conflict with the need \nfor food for a starving population and the country is overrun with locusts. Will \nthe use of pesticides enhance and protect the environment?\n \u2022 The EPA has stipulated that wastewater must be disinfected where people come \ninto contact with the water. However, the disinfectant may also kill naturally occurring beneficial microorganisms. Is this consistent with the second principle?\n \u2022 Suppose your expertise is water and wastewater chemistry. Your company has \naccepted a job to perform air pollution analysis and asks you to perform the work in the absence of a colleague who is the company\u2019s expert. Do you decline and risk being fired?\n \u2022 The public, your employers, and your client believe that dredging a lake to re-\nmove weeds and sediment will enhance the lake. However, the dredging will destroy the habitat for muskrats. How can you be impartial to all these constituencies?\n \u2022 You believe that a new regulation proposed by EPA is too expens"}
{"text": "ive to imple-\nment but you have no data to confirm that opinion. How do you respond to a local newspaper reporter asking for your opinion? Do you violate the fifth principle even though it is \u201cyour opinion\u201d that is being sought?\n We think it is important to point out that many environmentally related decisions such as those described above are much more difficult than the problems presented in the remaining chapters of this book. Frequently these problems are related more to ethics than to engineering. The problems arise when there are several courses of action with no a priori certainty as to which is best. Decisions related to safety, health, and welfare are easily resolved. Decisions as to which course of action is in the best inter-est of the public are much more difficult to resolve. Furthermore, decisions as to which course of action is in the best interest of the environment are at times in conflict with those that are in the best interest of the public. Whereas decisions made in the public interest are based on professional ethics, decisions made in the best interest of the environment are based on environmental ethics. Ethos, the Greek word from which \u201cethic\u201d is derived, means the character of a \nperson as described by his or her actions. This character was developed during the evolutionary process and was influenced by the need for adapting to the natural envi-ronment. Our ethic is our way of doing things. Our ethic is a direct result of our natural environment. Dur"}
{"text": "ing the latter stages of the evolutionary process, Homo sapiens  began \nto modify the environment rather than submit to what, millennia later, became known as Darwinian natural selection. As an example, consider the cave dweller who, in the chilly dawn of prehistory, realized the value of the saber-toothed tiger\u2019s coat and appropriated it for personal use. Inevitably a pattern of appropriation developed, and our ethic became more self-modified than environmentally adapted. Thus, we are no longer adapted to our natural environment but rather to our self-made environment. In the ecological context, such maladaptation results in one of two consequences: (1) the organism ( Homo sapiens) dies out; or (2) the organism evolves to a form and character dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 5  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 5  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles6  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nthat is once again compatible with the natural environment (Vesilind, 1975). Assuming \nthat we choose the latter course, how can this change in character (ethic) be brought about? Each individual must change his or her character or ethic, and the social system must change to become compatible with the global ecology. The acceptable system is one in which we learn to share our exhaustible resources\u2014to regain a balance. This requires that we "}
{"text": "reduce our needs and that the materials we use must be replenishable. We must treat all of the earth as a sacred trust to be used so that its content is neither diminished nor permanently changed; we must release no substances that cannot be reincorporated without damage to the natural system. The recognition of the need for such adaptation (as a means of survival) has developed into what we now call the environmental ethic (Vesilind, 1975).\n1-4 ENGINEERING DIMENSIONS AND UNITS\nThe FE Fundamentals of Engineering Supplied-Reference Handbook  uses the metric \nsystem of units. Ultimately, the FE examination will be entirely metric. However, currently some of the FE examination problems use both metric and U.S. Customary System (USCS) units. This text uses the metric system of units. Because the FE exami-nation has some problems in U.S. Customary units, we have included some example problems and some FE formatted end-of-chapter problems in U.S. Customary units. Our experience is that U.S. students are very familiar with the metric system of units and have an adequate knowledge of fundamental U.S. Customary System (USCS) units such as feet per second (ft/s or fps), miles per hour (mph), pounds mass (lb\nm), and gallons (gal) that we need not elaborate more than this brief reminder. How-\never, there are a small number of units and abbreviations that are particular to environ-mental engineering that we feel should be addressed here. They will be used without further elaboration in th"}

Engineers like to call this the  \u201csystems ap-proach, \u201d that is, looking at all the interrelated parts and their effects on one another. In environmental systems it is doubtful that mere mortals can ever hope to identify all the interrelated parts, to say nothing of trying to establish their effects on one another. The first thing the systems engineer does, then, is to simplify the system to a tractable size that behaves in a fashion similar to the real system. The simplified model does not behave in detail as the system does, but it gives a fair approximation of what is going on.  dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 7  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 7  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav0114"}

Pollution problems that are confined to one of these systems are called single-medium problems if the medium is either air, water, or soil. Many important environmental problems are not confined to one of these simple systems but cross the boundaries from one to the other. These problems are referred to as  multimedia  pollution problems.    \nWater Resource Management System   \nWater Supply Subsystem. The nature of the water source commonly determines the planning, design, and operation of the collection, purification, transmission, and distribution works.  *  The two major sources used to supply community and industrial needs are referred to as  surface water  and  groundwater.  Streams, lakes, and rivers are \nthe surface water sources. Groundwater sources are those pumped from wells.    Figure 1-2  depicts an extension of the water resource system to serve a small com-munity. The source in each case determines the type of collection works and the type of treatment works. The pipe network in the city is called the distribution system. The \nDivide\nCollection Works\n(Reservoir)\nTransmission\nWorks\nTreatment Works\n(Filt"}

Water in the mains generally is \nkept at a pressure between 200 and 860 kilopascals (kPa). Excess water produced by \nthe treatment plant during periods of low demand * (usually the nighttime hours) is \nheld in a storage reservoir. The storage reservoir may be elevated (the ubiquitous water tower), or it may be at ground level. The stored water is used to meet high demand dur-ing the day. Storage compensates for changes in demand and allows a smaller treat-ment plant to be built. It also provides emergency backup in case of a fire. Population and water-consumption patterns are the prime factors that govern the quantity of water required and hence the source and the whole composition of the water resource system. One of the first steps in the selection of a suitable water-supply source is deter"}
{"text": "mining the demand that will be placed on it. The essential elements of water de-mand include average daily water consumption and peak rate of demand. Average daily water consumption must be estimated for two reasons: (1) to determine the ability of the water source to meet continuing demands over critical periods when surface flows are low or groundwater tables are at minimum elevations, and (2) for purposes of estimating quantities of stored water that would satisfy demands during these critical periods. The peak demand rates must be estimated in order to determine plumbing and pipe sizing, pressure losses, and storage requirements necessary to supply sufficient water during periods of peak water demand.  \n Many factors influence water use for a given system. For example, the mere fact that water under pressure is available stimulates its use, often excessively, for watering lawns and gardens, for washing automobiles, for operating air-conditioning equip-ment, and for performing many other activities at home and in industry. The following factors have been found to influence water consumption in a major way:\n 1. Climate\n 2. Industrial activity\n 3. Meterage\n 4. System management\n 5. Standard of living\nThe following factors also influence water consumption but to a lesser degree: extent \nof sewerage, system pressure, water price, and availability of private wells.   If the demand for water is measured on a per capita\n\u2020 basis, climate is the most \nimportant factor influencing d"}

The average annual precipitation for the \u201cwet\u201d states is about 100 cm per year while the average annual precipitation for the \u201cdry\u201d states is only about 25 cm per year. Of course, the  dry  states are also considerably warmer than the wet states.\n   *Demand  is the use of water by consumers. This use of the word derives from the economic term meaning  \u201cthe  desire \nfor a commodity. \u201d The consumers express their desire by opening the faucet or flushing the water closet (W.C.).   \n \u2020Per capita is a Latin term that means  \u201cby heads. \u201d Here it means  \u201cper person. \u201d This assumes that each person has \none head (on the average).    dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 9  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 9  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles10  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The influence of industry is to increase per capita water demand. Small rural and \nsuburban communities will use less water per person than industrialized communities.  \n The third most important factor in water use is whether individual consumers have water meters. Meterage imposes a sense of responsibility not found in unmetered residences and businesses. This sense of responsibility reduces per capita water con-sumption because customers repair leaks and make more conservative water-use deci-sions almost re"}
{"text": "gardless of price. For residential consumers, water is so inexpensive, price is not much of a factor in water use. Water price is extremely important for indus-trial and farming operations that use large volumes of water.   Following meterage closely is the aspect called system management. If the water distribution system is well managed, per capita water consumption is less than if it is not well managed. Well-managed systems are those in which the managers know when and where leaks in the water main occur and have them repaired promptly.   Climate, industrial activity, meterage, and system management are more signifi-cant factors controlling water consumption than the standard of living. The rationale for the last factor is straightforward. Per capita water use increases with an increased standard of living. Highly developed countries use much more water than the less de-veloped nations. Likewise, higher socioeconomic status implies greater per capita water use than lower socioeconomic status.   The total U.S. water withdrawal for all uses (agricultural, commercial, domestic, mining, and thermoelectric power), including both fresh and saline water, was esti mated \nto be approximately 5,100 liters per capita per day (Lpcd) in 2005 (Kenny, et al., 2009). The amount for U.S. public supply (domestic, commercial, and industrial use) was estimated to be 550 Lpcd in 2005 (Kenny, et al., 2009).

For a family of three, this would amount to about 440 Lpcd. The variation in demand is normally reported as a factor of the average day. For metered dwellings the factors are as follows: maximum day 5 2.2 3 average day; peak hour 5 5.3 3 average day (Linaweaver et al., 1967). \nSome mid-Michigan average daily use figures and the contribution of various sectors to demand are shown in  Table 1-4.

To accomplish satisfactory results, human wastes must be disposed of so that:   \n 1. They will not contaminate any drinking water supply.    \n 2. They will not give rise to a public health hazard by being accessible to  vectors  \n(insects, rodents, or other possible carriers) that may come into contact with food or drinking water.    \n 3.

The source of wastewater may be either industrial wastewater or domestic sewage or both.  *  Industrial wastewater may be subject to some pretreatment on site if it has the potential to upset the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Federal regulations refer to municipal wastewater treatment systems as pub-licly owned treatment works, or POTWs.    The quantity of sewage flowing to the WWTP varies widely throughout the day in response to water usage. A typical daily variation is shown in  Figure 1-4 . Most of the water used in a community will end up in the sewer. Between 5 and 15 percent of the w ater is lost in lawn watering, car washing, and other consumptive uses. In warm, \ndry climates, consumptive use out of doors may be as high as 60 percent. Consumptive use may be thought of as the difference between the average rate that water flows into the distribution system and the average rate that wastewater flows into the WWTP (excepting the effects of leaks in the pipes).   The quantity of wastewater, with one exception, depends on the same factors that determine the quantity of water required for supply. The major exception"}

When manholes lie in low spots, there is the additional possibility of  inflow  through leaks in the manhole cover. \nOther sources of inflow include direct connections from roof gutters and downspouts, as well as sump pumps used to remove water from basement footing tiles.  Infiltration  and  inflow  (I  & I) are particularly important during rainstorms. The additional water \nfrom I  & I may hydraulically overload the sewer causing sewage to back up into houses as well as to reduce the efficiency of the WWTP. New construction techniques and materials have made it possible to reduce I  & I to insignificant amounts.   Sewers are classified into three categories: sanitary, storm, and combined. Sanita"}
{"text": "ry sewers  are designed to carry municipal wastewater from homes and commercial \nestablishments. With proper pretreatment, industrial wastes may also be discharged into these sewers.  Storm sewers  are designed to handle excess rainwater to prevent \nflooding of low areas. While sanitary sewers convey wastewater to treatment facilities, storm sewers generally discharge into rivers and streams.  Combined sewers  are \nexpected to accommodate both municipal wastewater and stormwater. These systems were designed so that during dry periods the wastewater is carried to a treatment facility. During rain storms, the excess water is discharged directly into a river, stream, or lake without treatment. Unfortunately, the storm water is mixed with untreated sewage. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has estimated that 40,000 overflows occur each year. Combined sewers are no longer being built in the United States. Many communities are in the process of replacing the combined sewers with separate systems for sanitary and storm flow.   When gravity flow is not possible or when sewer trenches become uneconomi-cally deep, the wastewater may be pumped. When the sewage is pumped vertically to discharge into a higher-elevation gravity sewer, the location of the sewage pump is called a  lift station.    Sewage treatment is performed at the WWTP to stabilize the waste material, that is, to make it less putrescible. The  effluent  from the WWTP may be discharged into an \nocean, lake, or"}

The by-product sludge from the \nWWTP also must be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner.   Whether the waste is discharged onto the ground or into a receiving body, care must be exercised not to overtax the assimilative capacity of the ground or receiving body. The fact that the wastewater effluent is cleaner than the river into which it flows does not justify the discharge if it turns out to be the proverbial  \u201cstraw that breaks the camel \u2019s back. \u201d  \n In summary, water resource management is the process of managing both the quantity and the quality of the water used for human benefit without destroying its availability and purity.     \nAir Resource Management System  \nOur air resource differs from our water resource in two important aspects. The first is in regard to quantity. Whereas engineering structures are required to provide an ade-quate water supply, air is delivered free of charge in whatever quantity we desire. The second aspect is in regard to quality. Unlike water, wh"}
{"text": "ich can be treated before we use it, it is impractical to go about with a gas mask on to treat impure air and with ear plugs in to keep out the noise.   The balance of cost and benefit to obtain a desired quality of air is termed  air \nresource management . Cost-benefit analyses can be problematic for at least two rea-\nsons. First is the question of what is desired air quality. The basic objective is, of course, to protect the health and welfare of people. But how much air pollution can we stand? We know the tolerable limit is something greater than zero, but tolerance varies from person to person. Second is the question of cost versus benefit. We know that we don \u2019t want to spend the entire Gross Domestic Product to ensure that no individual \u2019s health or welfare is impaired, but we do know that we want to spend some amount. Although the cost of control can be reasonably determined by standard engineering and economic means, the cost of pollution is still far from being quanti-tatively assessed.   Air resource management programs are instituted for a variety of reasons. The most defensible reasons are that (1) air quality has deteriorated and there is a need for correction, and (2) the potential for a future problem is strong.   In order to carry out an air resource management program effectively, all of the elements shown in  Figure 1-5  must be employed. (Note that with the appropriate sub-stitution of the word  water  for  air,  these elements apply to management of water "}

Generally, however, solid waste is considered a problem to be solved as cheaply as possible rather than a resource to be recovered. A simplified block diagram of a solid waste management system is shown in  Figure 1-6 .  \n While typhoid and cholera epidemics of the mid-1800s spurred water resource management efforts, and while air pollution episodes have prompted better air re-source management, we have yet to feel the impact of material or energy shortages dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 14  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 14  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesINTRODUCTION   15\n severe enough to encourage modern solid waste management. The landfill  \u201ccrisis \u201d of \nthe 1980s appears to have abated in the early 1990s due to new or expanded landfill capacity and to many initiatives to reduce the amount of solid waste generated. By 1999, more than 9,000 curbside recycling programs served roughly half of the U.S. population (U.S. EPA, 2005a).

An example is acid \nrain that results from the emission of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the atmo-sphere. These pollutants are washed out of the atmosphere, thus cleansing it, but in turn polluting water and changing the soil chemistry, which ultimately results in the death of fish and trees. Thus, our historic reliance on the natural cleansing processes of the atmosphere in designing air-pollution-control equipment has failed to deal with the multimedia nature of the problem. Likewise, disposal of solid waste by incineration results in air pollution, which in turn is controlled by scrubbing with water, resulting in a water pollution problem.   Three lessons have come to us from our experience with multimedia problems. First, it is dangerous to develop models that are too simplistic. Second, environmental engineers must use a multimedia approach and, in particular, work with a multidisci-plinary team to solve environmental problems. Third, the best solution to environmen-tal pollution is waste minimization \u2014if waste is not produced, it does not need to be treated or disposed of.\n1-6 ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AND REGULATION\nThe requirements of environmental legislation and regulation are major considerations in the selection of "}

The bill is given a designation, for example S. 2649 in the Senate or H.R. 5959 in the House. Bills often have \u201ccompanions\u201d in that similar bills may be started in both the Senate and House at the same time. The bill is given a title, for example, the \u201cSafe Drinking Water Act\u201d which implies an \u201cact\u201d of Congress. The act may be listed under one \u201cTitle\u201d or it may be divided into several Titles. References to the Titles of the act are given by roman numeral. For example, Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments establishes a list of hazardous air pollutants. Frequently a bill directs some executive branch of the governmen"}
{"text": "t such as the EPA to carry out an  action such as setting limits for contaminants. On occasion, such a bill includes spe-cific numbers for limits on contaminants. If the bills successfully pass the committee to which they are assigned, they are \u201creported out\u201d to the full Senate (for example, Senate Report 99-56) or to the full House (House Report 99-168). The first digits preceding the dash refer to the session of Congress during which the bill is reported out. In this example, it is the 99th Congress. If bills pass the full Senate/House they are taken by a joint committee of senators and congressional representatives (conference committee) to form a single bill for action by both the Senate and House. If the bill is adopted by a majority of both houses, it goes to the president for approval or veto. When the president signs the bill it becomes a law or statute. It is then designated, for example, as Public Law 99-339 or PL 99-339. This means it is the 339th law passed by the 99th Congress. The law or statute approved by the president\u2019s signature may alternatively be called an act that is referred to by the title assigned the bill in Congress. The Office of the Federal Register prepares the United States Statutes at Large  \nannually. This is a compilation of the laws, concurrent resolutions, reorganization plans, and proclamations issued during each congressional session. The statutes are numbered chronologically. They are not placed in order by subject matter. The short-hand"}

The United States Code is the compiled written set of laws in force on the day \nbefore the beginning of the current session of Congress (U.S. Code, 2005). Refer-ence is made to the U.S. Code by Title and Section number (for example, 42 USC 6901 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a76901). Table 1-5 gives a sample of titles and sections of environ-mental interest. Note that Titles of the U.S. Code do not match the Titles of the Acts of Congress.\nRegulations\nIn carrying out the directives of the Congress to develop a regulation or rule, the EPA or other executive branch of the government follows a specific set of formal procedures in a process referred to as rule making. The government agency (EPA, Department of Energy, Federal Aviation Agency, etc.) first publishes a proposed rule in the Federal \nRegister. The Federal Register is, in essence, the government\u2019s newspaper. It is pub-\nlished every day that the federal government is open for business. The agency provides the logic for the rule making (called a preamble) as well as the proposed rule and requests comments. The preamble may be several hundred pages in length for a rule that is only dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 17  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466dav01145_ch01_001-024.indd Page 17  9/16/11  9:15 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles18  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\na few lines long "}

The Shiny Plating Company is using about 2,000.0 kg/wk of organic \nsolvent for vapor degreasing of metal parts before they are plated. T"}
{"text": "he \nAir Pollution Engineering and Testing Company (APET) has measured the air in the workroom and in the stack that vents the degreaser. APET has determined that 1,985.0 kg/wk is being vented up the stack and that the workroom environment is within occupational standards. The 1,985.0 kg/wk is well above the allowable emission rate of 11.28 kg/wk.  \nElizabeth Fry, the plant superintendent, has asked J.R. Injuneer, the \nplant engineer, to review two alternative control approaches offered by APET and to recommend one of them.  \nThe first method is to purchase a pollution control device to put on \nthe stack. This control system will reduce the solvent emission to 1.0 kg/wk. Approximately 1,950.0 kg of the solvent which is captured each week can be recycled back to the degreaser. Approximately 34.0 kg of the solvent must be discharged to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). J. R. has determined that this small amount of solvent will not adversely affect the performance of the WWTP. In addition, the capital cost of the pollution control equipment will be recovered in about two years as a result of savings from recovering lost solvent.  \nThe second method is to substitute a solvent that is not on the list of \nregulated emissions. The price of the substitute is about 10 percent higher than the solvent currently in use. J. R. has estimated that the substitute solvent loss will be about 100.0 kg/wk. The substitute collects moisture and loses its effectiveness in about a month \u2019s time"}
{"text": ". The substitute solvent cannot be discharged to the WWTP because it will adversely affect the WWTP performance. Consequently, about 2,000 kg must be hauled to a hazardous waste disposal site for storage each month. Because of the lack of capital funds and the high interest rate for borrowing, J.

It is company policy that the spent chrome solution is put in 0.20-m \n3  drums and shipped \nto a hazardous waste disposal facility.  \nOn Thursday the 12th, the day shift miscalculates the amount of \nchrome to add to a new batch and makes it too strong. Since there is not enough room in the tank to adjust the concentration, Abe Lincoln, the shift supervisor, has the tank emptied and a new one prepared and makes a note to the manager that the bad batch needs to be reworked.  \nOn Monday the 16th, Abe Lincoln looks for the bad batch and can-\nnot find it. He notifies Ted Terrific that it is missing. Upon investigation, Ted finds that Rip Van-Winkle, the night-shift supervisor, dumped the batch into the sanitary sewer at 3:00 a.m. on Friday the 13th.

Under the Interstate Quarantine Act of 1893, the U.S. Public Health \nService (PHS) was empowered to make and enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. Interstate regulations were first promulgated in 1894 and the first water-related regulation (prohibiting the use of the \u201ccommon cup\u201d on interstate  carriers) was adopted in 1912. The first federal drinking water regulation was adopted in 1914. It established limits for bacterial contamination. In 1925, still acting under the 1893 Act, the PHS tightened the bacteriological standard and added physical and chem-ical standards. These were reviewed and updated periodically through the 1940s. In 1962, a comprehensive update of the standards was completed. These standards were accepted by all the states but were binding on only about 2 percent of the communities, that is those that served interstate carriers. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 (SDWA) also identified as Title XIV of the U.S. Public Health Service Act, was the first congressional act focused on drinking water. It directed the newly formed EPA to revise drinking-water regula"}
{"text": "tions to protect the public health. The Congress specified a two step process. First, it was to publish recommended maximum contaminant levels (RMCLs) for contaminants believed to have an adverse effect on health based on a study of health effects by the National Academy of Science. The RMCLs were to be set, with an adequate margin of safety, at a level that known or anticipated health effect would occur. The Congress specified that these levels were to be health goals and were not to be federally enforceable. EPA was then to set maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) as close to the RMCLs as the agency thought feasible. These became the National Primary Drinking Water Regula-tions. These standards applied to public water systems serving 25 or more people year-round or having 15 or more year-round service connections. The SDWA was amended and/or reauthorized in 1977, 1979, and 1980. The 1986 revision of the SDWA resulted in significant changes. The congressional focus was on strengthening the regulation-setting process which had lagged significantly under the Reagan administration. The 1986 Act required:\n 1. Mandatory standards for 83 contaminants by June 1989.\n 2. Mandatory regulation of 25 contaminants every 3 years.\n 3. Designation of best available technology (BAT) for each contaminant regulated.\n 4. Specification of criteria for deciding when filtration of surface water supplies \nis required.\n 5.

Reautho-\nrization was not completed until 1996. The 1996 SDWA amendments were signed into law by President Clinton as PL 104\u2013182. The amendments made substantial revisions to the act. Eleven new sec-tions were added. The amendments strengthened and expanded the protection of drinking water by providing grants for compliance and enforcement, enhanced  water-system capacity, operator training, and development of solutions to source pollution. In addition, it provided for public notification of violations within 24 hours (rather than 2 weeks under the old act), and annual reporting of levels of regulated contaminants to consumers.

In addition, EPA was required to develop a screening program to iden-tify the risks posed by substances that have an effect similar to that produced by naturally occurring estrogen and to screen pesticides and other chemicals for estrogenic effects. In a major shift from all preceding environmental rule making, Section 1412(b)(6) of the act requires that environmental regulations include an assessment of the costs and benefits. Furthermore, it permits the EPA administrator to \u201cpromulgate a maximum contaminant level for the contaminant that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost justified by the benefits.\u201d Prior to the enactment of this legislation, cost was not to be considered in the protection of human health and the environment.\nWater pollution control.   The federal role in water pollution control began with the \nPublic Health Service Act of 1912. This act established the Streams Investigation Station \nat Cincinnati to carry out water pollution research. The Oil Pollution Act was passed in 1924 to prevent oily discharges on coastal waters. During the 1930s and 1940s, there was a continuing debate over whether the federal government should take a greater role in controlling water pollution. This debate led to the limited expansion of federal powers expressed in the Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 (Table 1-1). The Federal Water  Pollution"}
{"text": " Control Act (FWPCA) of 1956, passed by overriding President Eisehower\u2019s veto (Percival, 2003), was the cornerstone of early federal efforts to  reduce pollution. Key elements of the act included a new program of subsidies for  municipal treatment plant construction and an expanded basis for federal legal action against polluters. In-creased funding for state water pollution control efforts and new support for research and training activities were also provided. Each of these programs was continued in the many amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Acts in the 1960s and 1970s.\n The Water Quality Act of 1965 carried forward many provisions of the earlier \nfederal legislation, generally with an increase in levels of funding. The 1965 act also introduced important new requirements for states to establish ambient water quality standards and detailed plans indicating how the standards would be met. The act also shifted responsibility for administering the federal water quality program from the U.S. Public Health Service to a separate agency, the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration, within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). This was not a permanent change. In 1970, a presidential reorganization order placed the water pollution control activities and several other federal environmental programs in the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).dav01145_studentwebsite_ch01_001-016.indd Page 2  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462dav01145_stude"}

{"text": "ally achievable\u201d  \n(BAT). After delays caused by numerous legal challenges to the EPA administrator\u2019s effluent limitations guidelines, the BPT provisions were implemented. However, the BAT requirements were so heavily disputed that Congress modified them in the Clean Water Act of 1977. The principal criticism of the original BAT effluent limitations was that the costs of the very high required percentage reductions in residuals would be much greater than the benefits. In defining BAT, costs were considered, but only in the general con-text of affordability by industry. Computations of the social benefits of stringent efflu-ent controls were not a central factor. Congress presumed the benefits of eliminating water pollutants would be substantial. Congressional insistence on very strict effluent limitations can also be interpreted as an effort to guarantee the rights of Americans to high-quality waters. In 1977, Congress responded to critics of BAT by requiring it only for toxic substances. A different requirement was introduced for \u201cconventional pollutants,\u201d such as biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids. The effluent limitations guidelines for these pollut-ants were to be based on the \u201cbest conventional pollutant control technology\u201d (BCT). The Clean Water Act of 1977 strongly endorsed the view that waterborne toxic substances must be controlled. The text of the act included a list of 65 substances, or classes of substances, to be used as the basis for defining toxics."}
{"text": " This list resulted from a 1976 settlement of a legal action in which several environmental organizations sued the EPA administrator for failing to issue toxic pollutant standards. This list was sub-sequently expanded by EPA to include 127 \u201cpriority pollutants\u201d (Table 1-2).\n Effluent limitations required by the FWPCA amendments of 1972 (and later the \nClean Water Act of 1977) formed the basis for issuing \u201cNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\u201d (NPDES) permits. The permit system idea stemmed from actions taken by the Department of Justice in the late 1960s. With the support of a favorable interpretation by the Supreme Court, attorneys for the United States relied on the 1899 River and Harbor Act to prosecute industrial sources of water pollution. The 1899 act, which was drafted originally to prohibit deposits of refuse in navigable waters to keep them clear for boat traffic, was interpreted in the 1960s as applying to liquid waste as well. In December 1970, the EPA administrator issued an executive order calling for a water quality management program using permits and penalties based on the River and Harbor Act of 1899. Although this program was delayed by court challenges in 1971, Congress made it a central part of the federal strategy embodied in the FWPCA amendments of 1972.\nAir Quality Management\nTwo factors stimulated the development of air pollution control legislation.

It \n established a program of federally funded research grants to be administered by the \nU.S. Public Health Service. The expansion of the federal government into air pollution control was a limited one.

Based on earlier auto emission control efforts in  California, the 1965 act gave the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare authority to establish permissible emission levels for new automobiles beginning with the 1968 model year. The control of emissions from older vehicles was left to individual states. The Air Quality Act of 1967 borrowed concepts from the Water Quality Control Act of 1965 by requiring states to develop ambient air quality standards and state im-plementation plans (SIPs) to achieve the standards. Implementation plans were to in-clude emission requirements for controlling air pollution and a timetable for meeting the requirements. Deadlines were set for submitting ambient standards, which were to be established on a region-wide basis. Although the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 continued many of the research and state aid programs established by prior legislation, several aspects of the amend-ments represented dramatic changes in str"}
{"text": "ategy. These involved (1) the requirement that the administrator of EPA set national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and emission standards for selected categories of new industrial facilities, and (2) the ex-plicit delineation (by Congress) of auto emission standards. Another manifestation of the expanded role of the federal government was the requirement of the 1970 amend-ments that the EPA administrator issue new source performance standards (NSPS). These standards were to control new stationary sources categorized by the administra-tor as contributing significantly to air pollution. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 relaxed the emission requirements some-what and extended the compliance deadlines into the early 1980s. They also defined a concept of prevention of significant deterioration  (PSD) areas and required that an area \nthat meets the national ambient standards for a given air pollutant be declared a PSD area for that pollutant. The amendments also defined three classes of PSD areas. For each class, numerical limits indicated the maximum permissible increment of air quality deg-radation from all new (or modified) stationary sources of pollution in an area. The 1977 amendments also indicated that significant new sources of pollution could locate in areas that did not meet the NAAQS, but only if certain conditions were satisfied. The amendments required that a significant new source locating in a nonat-tainment area (one which has not achieved the NAAQS) had"}

In addition, discharges from the new source had to be more than offset by reductions in emissions from other sources in the region. In 1979, the EPA extended the concept of emission offsets, as used in non- attainment areas, to a different context: multiple sources of air pollution generated at a single site. This extension, known as the bubble policy, is illustrated in Figure 1-1. The figure depicts a firm that must control releases from smokestacks at two adjacent plants. Before the bubble policy, the firm had to comply with emission standards that allowed only 100 Mg/d from each plant.* The total discharge was 200 Mg/d.

Using the bubble \npolicy, the firm is free to decide how to reduce residuals at each plant. The only restric-\ntion is that its total discharge must be no greater than 200 Mg/d. Imagine that a bubble \nsurrounds the two plants. The policy allows the f"}

In the early 1980s, the original \nbubble policy was extended to include plants that were not at the same location (mul-\ntiplant bubbles).\n The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) mandated that the EPA promulgate \nmore than 175 new regulations, 30 guidance documents, 35 studies, and 50 new research \ninitiatives. The Congressional mandates are categorized under eleven \u201c Titles \u201d in the Act. \nIt has become common to refer to the requirements of the CAAA by title number.\n In light of the fact that three previous deadlines for attainment had come and gone, \nTitle I establishes 16 new deadlines. Although these are primarily aimed at ozone, \nthere are also classifications for carbon monoxide and fine particulates.\n Provisions relating to mobile sources are spelled out in Title II. Cars are required to \nhave dashboard warning lights that signal whether or not pollution control equipment is \nworking. These devices frequently have impregnated chemicals that react with the pol-\nlutants. The life expectancy of these devices, in terms of miles driven, is specified as \n100,000 miles, rather than the previous requirement of 50,000 miles. Auto makers are \nFIGURE 1-1\nIllustration of bubble concept.dav01145_studentwebsite_ch01_001-016.indd Page 8  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462dav01145_studentwebsite_ch01_001-016.indd Page 8  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/"}

In addition, inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs for metropolitan areas have been expanded. Because the previous legislation establishing national emission standards for haz-ardous pollutants (NESHAPs) based on health risk proved too cumbersome, Title III established an initial list of 189 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) shown in Table 1-4 and directed EPA to establish emission standards based on technology.* These stan-dards are to be the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for a given source category.\n Under Title IV , the Act outlines a new nationwide approach to the problem of acid \nrain. The law sets up a market-based system to lower sulfur dioxide emissions. EPA will issue emission allowances to power plants listed in the act. The allowances are set below current emission levels. Plants may meet the allowances by installing control technology or by purchasing allowances from plants that have emissions below their allowance. For example, in November of 1994, Niagara Mohawk, which serves up-state New York, and the Arizona Public Service Co. traded emission allowances for carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Unlike the Clean Water Act, no provision for permits was included in the original Clean Air Act (1963). Title V remedies this deficiency by mak"}

A schedule for phasing out the production of ozone-destroying chemicals was promulgated in the Act with provision that EPA could accelerate the schedule. In 1993, EPA established an accelerated schedule that eliminated production of these chemicals by 2001.\nNoise Pollution Control\nThe federal government\u2019s activities in noise abatement are spread over several agen-cies by a variety of legislative acts. The emphasis is on specific activities already regu-lated separately by the various agencies. The landmark legislation in the area of occupational noise abatement was enacted in 1942 and is known as the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. This act  established minimum working conditions for employees of contractors who supply the federal government with materials, supplies, and equipment in excess of $10,000. However, it was not until 1969 that the Secretary of Labor interpreted this as applicable to noise! (Note: These applied only to supply contracts and not to construction contracts.) The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) enabled the Secretary of Labor to apply the Walsh-Healey standards with new meaning. Walsh-Healey merely excluded from bidding on federal contracts those suppliers who failed to meet minimum work condition standards. OSHA provided penalties for those suppliers, including civil an"}

The intent of this act was to\n 1. Promote the demonstration, construction, and application of solid waste man-\nagement and resource recovery systems.\n 2.

{"text": "stes from power plants and industrial steam plants. The Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965 was amended by Public Law 95-512, the Resources Recovery Act of 1970. The act directed that the emphasis of the national solid waste management program be shifted from disposal as its primary objective to that of recycling and reuse of recoverable materials in solid wastes or to the conversion of wastes to energy. Another feature of the 1970 act was the mandate of Congress to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to prepare a report on the treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes, including radioactive, toxic chemical, biological, and other wastes of significance to the public health and welfare.\nHazardous Wastes\nThe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, commonly known as RCRA (and pronounced \u201crick-rah\u201d) addresses the handling of hazardous waste at facilities currently operating and at those yet to be constructed. The act was designed in large part to meet disposal needs resulting from the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which require industries to remove hazardous substances from their air emissions and their wastewater discharges. Neither statute, however, ensures that the ultimate disposition of waste materials will be environmentally sound. RCRA was intended to provide that ensurance. RCRA does not, however, deal directly with abandoned sites or closed facilities where hazardous wastes have been handled or disposed of in the past. These locations are covered b"}

Finally, RCRA also does not control the disposition of hazardous substances within the productive stream of commerce. Such substances include chemicals covered by the Toxic Sub-stances Control Act of 1976 (PL 94-469), pesticides regulated under the Federal In-secticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1972 (PL 92-516), or other hazardous products subject to the 1975 Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and to other types of federal  regulation. The five major elements in the federal approach to hazardous waste management are:\n 1. Federal classification of hazardous waste\n 2. Cradle-to-grave manifest (record-keeping) system\n 3. Federal standards for safeguards to be followed by generators, transporters, \nand facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste\n 4. Enforcement of federal standards for facilities through a permit program\n 5.

{"text": "_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles1-14  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n Unhappy with the progress in implementing RCRA, Congress in 1984 passed the \nHazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA, pronounced \u201chiss-wah\u201d). The scope of RCRA was significantly increased. Under the legislation:\n 1. Waste minimization was established as the preferred method for managing \nhazardous waste.\n 2. Untreated hazardous waste was banned from land disposal and EPA was \n directed to establish treatment standards for land disposal.\n 3. New technology standards, such as double liners, leachate collection systems, \nand extensive groundwater monitoring, were established for land disposal \n facilities.\n 4. New requirements were established for small quantity generators.\n 5. The EPA was directed to establish standards for underground storage tanks.\n 6. The EPA was directed to evaluate criteria for municipal solid waste landfills \nand upgrade monitoring requirements.\n The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) provided authority for removal of hazardous substances from  improperly constructed or operated active sites not in compliance with RCRA and from inactive disposal sites. The most fundamental feature of CERCLA is that it provides basic operating au-thority to the federal government to take direct action to remove hazardous substances from dangerous inactive disposal sites and to assist with cleaning up emergency spills. This includes "}
{"text": "authority to carry out investigations, testing, and monitoring of disposal sites. It also includes authority to implement remedial measures to remove contami-nants in the groundwater. CERCLA earned its nickname, \u201cSuperfund,\u201d from the provision of a $1.6 billion Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund. Seven-eighths of the money is to be pro-vided by industry through taxes on crude oil, certain petroleum products, and 42 chemi-cal feedstocks; one-eighth is to be provided by government through appropriations from general revenues. In cases where responsibility for the wastes that cause contamination can be traced to companies with financial resources, CERCLA places financial responsibility for the cleanup on those companies. The statute establishes a set of federal laws under which liability can be imposed on such companies even when they are only indirectly involved in the ownership or operation of the facilities where the wastes were disposed. After the government has identified a site as a threat to the environment, it may call upon those  liable companies to undertake the cleanup at their own cost. Alternatively, if such com-panies refuse to assume responsibility for the cleanup, the government can carry out the remedial program using money from the fund and then bring suit against the companies for reimbursement. A National Contingency Plan (NCP) establishes the rules for how EPA will use its authority and spend its money. To qualify for expenditure of CERCLA funds, a site"}

As of 2004, 1,244 \nsites had been placed on the NPL (U.S. EPA, 2005b). In addition, CERCLA contains notice requirements for all releases (spills) of reportable quantities of hazardous sub-stances and creates a Post-Closure Liability Fund for qualified disposal facilities. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 extended the provisions of CERCLA. In addition to establishing an $8.5 billion fund for cleanup, SARA directs or establishes that EPA:\n 1. Revise the NPL and the HRS on which it is based.\n 2. Revise the NCP.\n 3. Is authorized to subpoena documents and witnesses.\n 4. Can spend money to investigate sites and design remedies, and can permit \nprivate parties to conduct cleanup.\n 5.

The act established the Atomic Energy Commis-sion (AEC) and directed it to conduct research and development on peaceful applica-tions of fissionable and radioactive materials. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 provided for control of uranium and thorium (\u201csource material\u201d for nuclear reactors), plutonium and enriched uranium (classified as special nuclear material because of their potential use in atomic weapons), and other by-products of the nuclear industry. The Energy Re-organization Act of 1974 divided the developmental and regulatory functions of the AEC between two agencies: the Energy and Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). In restructuring the adminis-tration of ener gy-related matters after the Arab oil boycott, the Energy Organization \nAct of 1977 replaced ERDA with the Department of Energy (DOE). The NRC was given jurisdiction over reactor construction and operation. It regulates the possession, use, tran"}

Each state is responsible for providing for the availability of capacity either within or outside the state for disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders. States were encouraged to enter into compacts with their neighbors to more efficiently manage the waste. The law allowed the compacts to exclude wastes from other regions and allowed existing disposal sites to impose surcharges for disposal of wastes from regions without sites. The surcharge was to be used for site development. Difficulties in negotiating the compacts prompted the enactment of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1985 (LLRWPAA). It stipulated that the three existing commercial sites remain open for use by all states through 1992. Annual and total limits on the volume of waste that can be sent from reactors were established. DOE is "}

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 directed DOE to develop a plan for stor-age of high-level radioactive waste. Following the requirements of the law, DOE began investigation of nine sites in the west and two in the east. Under the act, the EPA established standards that specified release limits for 1,000 and 10,000 years after disposal. Because of loudly voiced concern over the direction of the DOE\u2019s mission plan and the decision to abandon the search for a repository site in the east, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1987. The amendments restructured DOE\u2019s high-level waste program. The only site that would be considered would be Yucca Flats, Nevada. Furthermore, spent fuel would be required to be shipped in NRC-approved packages after notification of state and local governments. During the years 2007-2010, DOE is to study the need for a second repository. For mixed wastes, that is, both hazardous and radioactive, RCRA and HSWA ap-ply to the hazardous characteristic. As of 1987, disposal rules must comply with both NRC rules for radioactivity and EPA rules for hazardous constituents. Before then, only the NRC rules applied. Likewise, for leaking disposal sites, CERCLA and SARA rules apply as well as the NRC rules. Radiation exposure from x-rays and medical diagnosis and "}

They serve as a method of accounting for the flow of energy and materials into and out of environmental systems. Mass balances provide us with a tool for "}
{"text": "modeling the production, transport, and fate of pollutants in the environment. Energy balances likewise provide us with a tool for modeling the production, transport, and fate of energy in the environment. \nApplications\nExamples of the application of mass balances include prediction of rainwater runoff (Chapter 4), oxygen balance in streams (Chapter 7), and audits of hazardous waste production (Chapter 12). Energy balances predict the temperature rise in a stream from the discharge of cooling water from a power plant (Chapter 7), and the temperature rise due to global warming (Chapter 9).\n2-2 UNIFYING THEORIES\nConservation of Matter\nThe law of conservation of matter states that (without nuclear reaction) matter can neither \nbe created nor destroyed. This is a powerful theory. It means that if we observe an envi-\nronmental process carefully, we should be able to account for the \u201cmatter\u201d at any point in time. It does not mean that the form of the matter does not change nor, for that matter, the properties of the matter. Thus, if we measure the volume of a fresh glass of water on the counter on Monday and measure it again a week later and find the volume to be less, \nwe do not presume magic has occurred but rath er that matter has changed in form. The law \nof conservation of matter says we ought to be able to account for all the mass of the water that was originally present, that is, the mass of water remaining in the glass plus the mass of water vapor that has evaporated equals"}
{"text": " the mass of water originally present. The math-ematical representation of this accounting system is called a materials balance or mass \nbalance.\nConservation of Energy\nThe law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. \nLike the law of conservation of matter, this theory means that we should be able to account for the \u201cenergy\u201d at any point in time. It also does not mean that the form of the energy does not change. Thus, we should be able to trace the energy of food through a series of organisms from green plants through animals. The mathematical representation of the accounting system we use to trace energy is called an energy balance.\nConservation of Matter and Energy\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Albert Einstein hypothesized that matter could be transformed to energy and vice versa. The birth of the nuclear age proved his hypoth-esis correct, so today we have a combined law of conservation of matter and energy  dav01145_ch02_025-084.indd Page 26  9/19/11  7:31 PM user-f466dav01145_ch02_025-084.indd Page 26  9/19/11  7:31 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesMATERIALS AND ENERGY BALANCES   27\nthat states that the total amount of energy and matter is constant.

Thus, there are gener-ally two separate balances for mass and energy.\n2-3 MATERIALS BALANCES\nFundamentals\nIn its simplest form a materials balance or mass balance may be viewed as an account-\ning procedure. You perform a form of material balance each time you balance your checkbook.\n Ba\nlance 5deposit2withdrawa l (2-1)\n For an environmental process, the equation would be written Accumu\nlation5input 2output (2-2)\nwhere accumulation, input, and output refer to the mass quantities accumulating in the \nsystem or flowing into or out of the system. The \u201csystem\u201d may be, for example, a pond, river, or a pollution control device.\nThe Control Volume.  Using the mass balance approach, we begin solving the prob-\nlem by drawing a flowchart of the process or a conceptual diagram of the environmen-tal subsystem. All of the known inputs, outputs, and accumulation are converted to the same mass units and placed on the diagram. Unknown inputs, outputs, and accumula-tion are also marked on the diagram. This helps us define the problem. System bound-aries (imaginary blocks around the process or part of the process) are drawn in such a way that calculations are made as simple as possible. The system within the boundaries is called the control volume. We then write a materials balance equation to solve for unknown inputs, outputs, or accumulations or to demonstrate that we have accounted for all of the components by demonst"}
{"text": "rating that the materials balance \u201ccloses,\u201d that is, the accounting balances. Alternatively, when we do not have data for all inputs or outputs, we can assume that the mass balance closes and solve for the unknown quantity. The following example illustrates the technique.\nExample 2-1. Mr. and Mrs. Green have no children. In an average week they pur-\nchase and bring into their house approximately 50 kg of consumer goods (food, maga-zines, newspapers, appliances, furniture, and associated packaging). Of this amount, 50 percent is consumed as food. Half of the food is used for biological maintenance and ultimately released as CO\n2; the remainder is discharged to the sewer system. The \nGreens recycle approximately 25 percent of the solid waste that is generated. Approxi-\nmately 1 kg accumulates in the house. Estimate the amount of solid waste they place at the curb each week.dav01145_ch02_025-084.indd Page 27  9/19/11  7:31 PM user-f466dav01145_ch02_025-084.indd Page 27  9/19/11  7:31 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles28  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nSolution.

In some instances, it may be necessary to select multiple control volumes and then solve the problem sequentially using the solution from one control volume as the input to another control volume. For some complex processes, the appropriate control volume may treat all of the steps in the process as a \u201cblack box\u201d in which the internal process steps are not required and therefore are hidden in a black box.

The flow rate for each section of pipe is also shown by the arrows at each section of pipe. The capacity of each pipe is 0.120 m\n3/s. \nDuring large rainstorms, River Street floods below junction number 1 because the flow of water exceeds the capacity of the storm sewer pipe. To alleviate this problem and to provide extra capacity for expansion, it is proposed to build a retention pond to hold the storm water until the storm is over and then gradually release it.

Consider a coffee cup containing approximately 200 mL of black cof-fee (or another beverage of your choice). If we add a dollop (about 20 mL) of cream and immediately take a sample (or a sip), we would not be surprised to find that the cream was not evenly distributed throughout the coffee. If, on the o"}
{"text": "ther hand, we mixed the coffee and cream vigorously and then took a sample, it would not matter if we sipped from the left or right of the cup, or, for that matter, put a valve in the bot-tom and sampled from there, we would expect the cream to be distributed evenly. In terms of a mass balance on the coffee cup system, the cup itself would define the system boundary for the control volume. If the coffee and cream were not mixed well, \nthen the place we take the sample from would strongly affect the value of d (out)/dt in \nEquation 2-4. On the other hand, if the coffee and cream were instantaneously well mixed, then any place we take the sample from would yield the same result. That is, any output would look  exactly like the contents of the cup. This system is called a completely mixed system. A more formal definition is that completely mixed systems  \nare those in which every drop of fluid is homogeneous with every other drop, that is, every drop of fluid contains the same concentration of material or physical property (e.g., temperature). If a system is completely mixed, then we may assume that the output from the system (concentration, temperature, etc.) is the same as the contents within the system boundary. Although we frequently make use of this assumption to solve mass balance problems, it is often very difficult to achieve in real systems. This means that solutions to mass balance problems that make this assumption must be taken as approximations to reality. If comple"}
{"text": "tely mixed systems exist, or at least systems that we can approximate as completely mixed, then it stands to reason that some systems are completely unmixed or approximately so. These systems are called plug-flow systems. The behavior of a plug-\nflow system is analogous to that of a train moving along a railroad track (Figure 2-1). Each car in the train must follow the one preceding it. If, as in Figure 2-1b, a tank car is inserted in a train of box cars, it maintains its position in the train until it arrives at its destination. The tank car may be identified at any point in time as the train travels down the track. In terms of fluid flow, each drop of fluid along the direction of flow remains unique and, if no reactions take place, contains the same concentration of material or physical property that it had when it entered the plug-flow system. Mixing may or may not occur in the radial direction. As with the completely mixed systems, ideal plug-flow systems don\u2019t happen very often in the real world. When a system has operated in such a way that the rate of input and the rate of output are constant and equal, then, of course, the mass rate of accumulation is zero (i.e., in Equation 2-4 dM/dt 5 0). This condition is called steady state. In solving mass \nbalance problems, it is often convenient to make an assumption that steady-state con-ditions have been achieved. We should note that steady state does not imply equilib-\nrium. For example, water running into and out of a pond "}

In these instances the substance is said to be conserved. Examples of conservative substances include salt in \nwater and argon in air.

A batch reactor is used for small volumetric flow rates. When water flow \nrates are greater than 150 m3/d, a CSTR may be selected for chemical mixing. Exam-\nples of this application include equalization reactors to adjust the pH, precipitation reactors to remove metals, and mixing tanks (called rapid mix or flash mix tanks) for \nwater treatment. Because municipal wastewater flow rates vary over the course of a day, a CSTR (called an equalization basin) may be placed at the treatment plant influ-ent point to level out the flow and concentration changes. Some natural systems such as a lake or the mixing of two streams or the air in a room or over a city may be mod-eled as a CSTR as an approximation of the real mixing that is taking place. For a step increase in a conservative substance entering a CSTR, the initial level of the conservative substance in the reactor is C\no prior to t  5 0. At t  5 0, the influent \nconcentration ( Cin) instantaneously increases to C1 and remains at this concentration \n(Figure 2-8a ).

As with the law of conservation of matter, it does not mean that \nthe form of the energy does not change. For example, the chemical energy in coal can be changed to heat and electrical power. Energy is defined as the capacity to do useful work. Work is done by a force acting on a body through a distance. One joule (J) is the work \ndone by a constant force of one newton when the body on which the force is exerted moves a distance of one meter in the direction of the force. Power is the rate of doing \nwork or the rate of expanding energy. The first law may be expressed as\n Q\nH5U22U11W (2-43)\nwhere QH 5 heat absorbed, kJ\n U1, U2 5  internal energy (or thermal energy) of the system in states 1 and 2, \nkJ\nW 5 work, kJ\nFundamentals\nThermal"}
{"text": " Units of Energy.  Energy has many forms, among which are thermal, me-\nchanical, kinetic, potential, electrical, and chemical. Thermal units were invented when heat was considered a substance (caloric), and the units are consistent with conserva-tion of a quantity of substance. Subsequently, we have learned that energy is not a  substance but mechanical energy of a particular form. With this in mind we will still use the common metric thermal unit of energy, the calorie.* One calorie (cal) is the \namount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 14.58C to 15.58C. In SI units 4.186 J 5 1 cal. The specific heat of a substance is the quantity of heat required to increase a unit \nmass of the substance one degree. Specific heat is expressed in metric units as kcal/\nkg?K and in SI units as kJ/kg ?K where K is kelvins and 1 K 5 18C.\n Enthalpy is a thermodynamic property of a material that depends on temperature, \npressure, and the composition of the material. It is defined as\n H5U1P V (2-44)\n*In discussing food metabolism, physiologists also use the term Calorie. However, the food Calorie is equivalent \nto a kilocalorie in the metric system.

This is, of course, not possible and leads us to the second law of thermodynamics.\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that energy flows from a region of higher concentration to one of lesser concentration, not the reverse, and that the quality de-grades as it is transformed. All natural, spontaneous processes may be studied in the light of the second law, and in all such cases a particular one-sidedness is found. Thus, heat always flow"}
{"text": "s spontaneously from a hotter body to a colder one; gases seep through an opening spontaneously from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure. The second law recognizes that order becomes disorder, that randomness in-creases, and that structure and concentrations tend to disappear. It foretells elimination of gradients, equalization of electrical and chemical potential, and leveling of contrasts in heat and molecular motion unless work is done to prevent it. Thus, gases and liquids left by themselves tend to mix, not to unmix; rocks weather and crumble; iron rusts. The degradation of energy as it is transformed means that enthalpy is wasted in the transformation. The fractional part of the heat which is wasted is termed unavailable energy.

Efficiency (h ) or, perhaps, lack of efficiency is another expression of the second \nlaw. Sadi Carnot (1824) was the first to approach the problem of the efficiency of a heat engine (e.g., a steam engine) in a truly fundamental manner. He described a theo-retical engine, now called a Carnot engine. Figure 2-17 is a simplified representation of a Carnot engine.

This equation implies \nthat maximum efficiency is achieved when the value of T2 is as high as possible and \nthe value for T 1 is as low as possible.\n Another way to evaluate efficiency is to estimate the power output for a given heat input per unit of time. This technique is used to evaluate the efficiency of electric power generation in fossil fuel power plants. The technique is illustrated in Example 2-15.\nExample 2-15.

Hazard implies a proba-\nbility of adverse effects in a particular situation. Risk is a measure of the probability. In \nsome instances the measure is subjective, or perceived risk. Engineers and scientists \nuse models to calculate an estimated risk. In some instances actual data may be used to estimate the risk. \nApplications\nWe make estimates of risk for a wide range of environmental phenomena. Examples include the risk of tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, landslides, and forest fires. In this chapter we have chosen to limit our discussion to the risk to human health from chemicals released to the environment. In Chapter 4 we will use the probability con-cepts developed in this chapter as a forecasting tool for the risk of floods and droughts. In the last three decades an attempt has been made to bring more rigor to the esti-mation of risk exposu"}
{"text": "re to chemicals released to the environment. Today this process is called quantitative risk assessment, or more simply risk assessment. The use of the results of a risk assessment to make policy decisions is called risk management.  \nChapters 6\u201313 discuss alternative measures for managing risk by reducing the amount of contaminants in the environment.\n3-2 PROBABILITY AND RISK\nTypes of Probability\nProbability may be discussed as theory based on a subjective determination of fair \nodds, or an equally likely set of events, or as relative frequencies. \nSubjective Probability.  Risk perception is a form of subjective probability. When \npeople feel that they have enough experience, they assess the \u201codds\u201d that their hypoth-\nesis about the risk of an environmental contaminant might be true. The amount of in-formation or experience is the basis for assessing the odds. For example, 1:10 odds indicate a different level of belief or information about a situation than 1:2 odds do. Odds of 1:10 indicate an assessment of probability as 1/11. Odds of 1:2 indicate a probability of 1/3. Changes in information may change subjective probability.  Subjective probability is not based on a quantitative analysis. It is not appropriate for estimating risk to the public. However, risk perception often makes it difficult to achieve social change when quantitative analysis is at odds with subjective probability. It is discussed in this chapter under the heading \u201cRisk Perception.\u201d\nRelative Frequency. For"}
{"text": " a long series of coin tosses, we generally expect heads or \ntails to be equally likely. For a very long sequence of trials, we may think of probability as the relative frequency of particular events. Thus, we think of the probability of a particular coin falling heads as the ratio of the number of heads occurring to the total number of tosses in a sequence. This form of probability is the one most frequently used in the determination of risk to the public from environmental hazards. Examples are probability of a flood or drought. This type of risk assessment will be addressed in Chapter 4.dav01145_ch03_085-109.indd Page 86  20/09/11  9:17 PM user-f501dav01145_ch03_085-109.indd Page 86  20/09/11  9:17 PM user-f501 /207/MHBR245/edm25362_disk1of1/0078025362/edm25362_pagefiles/207/MHBR245/edm25362_disk1of1/0078025362/edm25362_pagefilesRISK ASSESSMENT   87\nEqually Likely. If we select one person from a well-mixed group of 500,000 people, \nwe may consider any of the 500,000 people equally likely to be chosen. This sense of probability only exists if there is a finite set of likely possibilities. An example is when people are chosen for a public opinion poll. This is also the case if we are examining the consequences from exposure to a chemical for a certain class of people. The set of peo-ple is carefully limited.  An example is children in the age group 1 to 5 at an abandoned hazardous waste site. The axioms and theorems for finite sets are quantitative. They are appropriate for "}

They are the basis for the discussion in this chapter.\nRisk Perception\nThere is an old political saying: \u201cPerception is reality.\u201d This is no less true for environ-mental concerns than it is for politics. People respond to the hazards they perceive. If their perceptions are faulty, risk management efforts to improve environmental protec-tion may be misdirected. Some risks are well quantified. For example, the frequency and severity of auto-mobile accidents are well documented. In contrast, other hazardous activities such as the use of alcohol and tobacco are more difficult to document. Their assessment re-quires complex epidemiological studies (Slovic et al., 1979). When lay people (and some experts for that matter) are asked to evaluate risk, they seldom have ready access to the statistics. In most cases, they rely on inferences based on their experience. People are likely to judge an event as likely or frequent if in-stances of it are easy to imagine or recall. Also, it is evident that acceptable risk is in-versely related to the number of people participating in the activity. In addition, recent events such as a disaster can seriously distort risk judgments. Figure 3-1 illustrates different perceptions of risk. Four different groups were asked to rate thirty activities and technologies according to the present risk of death from each. Three of the groups were from"}

They included 30 col-lege students, 40 members of the League of Women V oters (LOWV), and 25 busi-ness and professional members of the \u201cActive Club.\u201d The fourth group was composed of 15 people selected from across the United States because of their professional involvement in risk assessment. The groups were asked to estimate the mean fatality \nfor the same group of activities and technologies given the fact that the annual death toll from motor vehicle accidents in the United States was 50,000. The lines in Figure 3-1 are the lines of best fit to the results. If the lines were at 45 de grees, \nthe estimate would be perfect. The steeper slope of the line for the e xperts\u2019 risk \njudgments shows that they are more closely associated with the actual annual fatality rates than those of the lay groups. Putting risk perception into perspective, we can calculate the risk of death from some familiar causes. To begin, we recognize that we all will die at some time. So, as a trivial example, the lifetime risk of death from all causes is 100 percent, or 1.0. In the United States, in 2001, there were about 3.9 million deaths from all causes. Of these, 541,532 were cancer related (National Center for Health statistics, 2004). In 2001, of those dying, the probability that an individual died of cancer was about\n541,532\n3.9310650.14dav01145_ch03_085-109.indd Page 87  11/5/11  1:17 AM user-f466dav01145_ch03_085-109.indd Page 87  11/5/11  1:17 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/"}

The population of the United States is esti-\nmated to have been about 300 million.

You may note that there are no units for the risk calculation. In addition, the de-scription of the character of the risk is an important qualifier. Some example qualifiers are whether or not the risk is an annual risk or a lifetime risk, or whether the risk is an average over the whole population or for a particular set of people.  In addition, we understand that if the risk of dying in one year is increased, the risk of dying from another cause in a later year is decreased. Because accidents often occur early in life, a typical accident may shorten life by 30 years. In contrast, diseases, such as cancer typically cause death later in life, and life is shortened by about 15 years. Therefore, a risk of 10\n26 shortens life on the average of 30 3 1026 years, or 15 minutes, for an accident. \nThe same risk for "}

With these data, it is possible to initially identify potential exposure pathways and exposure points important for as-sessing exposure. A conceptual model of pathways and exposure points can be formed from the background data and site information. This conceptual model can then be used to help refine data needs.\nToxicity Assessment\nToxicity assessment is the process of determining the relationship between the exposure to a contaminant and the increased likelihood of the oc currence or severity of adverse effects to people. This procedure includes hazard identification and dose-res"}
{"text": "ponse evalu-ation. Hazard identification  determines whether exposure to a contaminant causes in-\ncreased adverse effects towards humans and to what level of severity. Dose-response  \nevaluation uses quantitative information on the dose of the contaminant and relates it to the incidence of adverse health in an exposed population. Toxicity values can be deter-mined from this quantitative relationship and used in the risk characterization step to estimate different occurrences of adverse health effects based on various exposure levels. The single factor that determines the degree of harmfulness of a compound is the dose of that compound (Loomis, 1978). Dose is defined as the mass of chemical received by the animal or exposed individual. Dose is usually expressed in units of milligrams per kilogram of body mass (mg/kg). Some authors use parts per million (ppm) instead of mg/kg. Where the dose is administered over time, the units may be mg/kg ?  d. It should \nbe noted that dose differs from the concentration of the compound in the medium (air, water, or soil) to which the animal or individual is  exposed. For toxicologists to establish the \u201cdegree of harmfulness\u201d of a compound, they must be able to observe a quantitative effect. The ultimate effect manifested is death of the organism. Much more subtle effects may also be observed. Effects on body weight, blood chemistry, and enzyme inhibition or induction are examples of graded responses.  \nMortality and tumor formation are examp"}
{"text": "les of quantal (all-or-nothing) responses. If a dose is sufficient to alter a biological mechanism, a harmful consequence will result. The experimental determination of the range of changes in a biologic mechanism to a range of doses is the basis of the dose-response relationship. The statistical variability of organism response to dose is commonly expressed as a cumulative-frequency distribution known as a dose-response curve. Figure 3-2  illustrates the method by which a common toxicological measure, namely the LD\n50, or \nlethal dose for 50 percent of the animals, is obtained. The assumption inherent in the plot of the dose-response curve is that the test population variability follows a Gaussian distribution and, hence, that the dose-response curve has the statistical properties of a Gaussian cumulative-frequency curve. Toxicity is a relative term. That is, there is no absolute scale for establishing toxicity; one may only specify that one chemical is more or less toxic than another. Comparison of different chemicals is uninformative unless the organism or biologic mechanism is the same and the quantitative effect used for comparison is the same. Figure 3-2 serves to illustrate how a toxicity scale might be developed. Of the two curves in the figure, the LD\n50 for compound B is greater than that for compound A. Thus, for the test animal \nrepresented by the graph, compound A is more toxic than compound B as measured by lethality. There are many difficulties in establishing "}

The shape (slope) of the dose- response curve may differ for different \ncompounds so that a high LD 50 may be associated with a low \u201cno observed adverse \neffect level\u201d (NOAEL) and vice versa. The nature of a statistically obtained value, such as the LD\n50, tends to obscure a \nfundamental concept of toxicology: that there is no fixed dose that can be relied on to produce a given biologic effect in every member of a population. In Figure 3-2, the mean value for each test group is plotted. If, in addition, the extremes of the data are plotted as in Figure 3-3, it is apparent that the response of individual members of the population may vary widely from the mean. This implies not only that single point comparisons, such as the LD\n50, may be misleading, but that even knowing the slope of \nthe average dose-response curve may not be sufficient if one wishes to protect hypersen-sitive individuals.

Aside from the difficulty of extrapolat-ing from one species to another, the testing of animals to estimate low-dose response is difficult. Example 3-1 illustrates the problem.\nExample 3-1.  An experiment was developed to ascertain whether a compound has a \n5 percent probability of causing a tumor. The same dose of the compound was admin-istered to 10 groups of 100 test animals. A control group of 100 animals was, with the exception of the test compound, exposed to the same environmental conditions for the same period of time. The following results were obtained:\nGroup No. of Tumors\nA  6\nB  4\nC 10\nD  1\nE  2\nF  9\nG  5\nH  1\nI  4\nJ  7\nNo tumors were detected in the controls (not likely in reality).\nSolution.  The average number of excess tumors is 4.9 percent. These results tend to \nconfirm that the probability of causing a tumor is 5 percent.\nComments:\n1.  If, instead of using 1,000 animals (10 groups 3 100 animals), only 100 animals \nwere used, it is fairly evident from the data that, statistically speaking, some very anomalous results might be achieved. That is, we might find a risk from 1 percent to 10 percent.\n2.  Note that a 5 percent risk (probability of 0.05) is very high in comparison to the \nEPA\u2019s o"}

This is called the one-hit hypothesis. From this hypoth-\nesis, it is assumed that there is no threshold dose below which the risk is zero, so that for carcinogens, there is no NOAEL and the dose-response curve passes through the origin. Many models have been proposed for extrapolation to low doses. The selection of an appropriate model is more a policy decision than a scientific one since there are no data to confirm or refute any model. The one-hit model is frequently used:\n P(d)512exp( 2"}

At low doses, the slope \nof the dose-response curve is represented by a slope factor (SF). It has units of risk per \nunit dose or risk (kg ? d/mg). The EPA maintains a toxicological data base called IRIS (Integrated Risk Infor-mation System) that provides background information on potential carcinogens. IRIS includes suggested values for the slope factor. A list of slope factors for several com-pounds is shown in Table 3-3. In contrast to the carcinogens, it is assumed that for noncarcinogens there is a dose below which there is no adverse effect; that is, there is an NOAEL. The EPA has estimated the acceptable daily intake, or reference dose (RfD), that is likely to be \nwithout appreciable risk. The RfD is obtained by dividing the NOAEL by safety fac-tors to account for the transfer from animals to humans, sensitivity, and other uncer-tainties in developing the data.

The proce-dure in transferring animal data to people is then to find the \u201cproper\u201d species and study it in context. Observed differences are then often quantitative rather than qualitative. Carcinogenicity as a result of application or administration to lab animals is often assumed to be transposable to people because of the seriousness of the consequence of ignoring such evidence. However, slowly induced, subtle toxicity\u2014because of the effects of ancillary factors (environment, age, etc.)\u2014is difficult at best to transfer. This becomes even more difficult when the incidence of toxicity is restricted to a small hypersensitive subset of the population.\nLimitations of Epidemiological Studies.  There are four difficulties in epidemio-\nlogical studies of toxicity in human populations. The first is that large populations are required to detect a low frequency of occurrence of a toxicological effect. The second difficulty is that there may be a long or highly variable latency period between the exposure to the toxicant and a measurable effect.

The fourth difficulty is that epidemiological studies are often based on data collected in specific political boundaries that do not necessarily coincide with environmental boundaries such as those defined by an aquifer or the prevailing wind patterns.\nExposure Assessment\nThe objective of this step is to estimate the magnitude of exposure to chemicals of potential concern. The magnitude of exposure is based on chemical intake and path-ways of exposure. The most important route (or pathway) of exposure may not always be clearly established. Arbitrarily eliminating one or more routes of exposure is not scientifically sound. The more reasonable approach is to consider a"}

For the \u201cFood Ingestion\u201d route listed in Table 3-5, there is an \nespecially important additional consideration for the consumption of contaminated fish. Fish that live in contaminated water tend to accumulate contaminants so that con-centration of contaminants in the edible tissue is much higher than in the water they live in. Because it is much more difficult to obtain comprehensive data on concentra-tions of contaminants in fish than it is to obtain concentrations of contaminants in water, EPA has developed bioconcentration factors. The bioconcentration factor is an estimate of the concentration of contaminant in the edible portion of the fish. It is based on measurements of the equilibrium concentration of contaminant in fish that have lived in water containing a known concentration of contaminant. With the bio-concentration factor, the concentration in fish may be estimated as \n Concentration in fish 5 (CW) 3 (BCF) \n (3-9)\nwhere Concentration in fish is in mg/kg\nCW 5 concentration in water, mg/L\nBCF 5 bioconcentration factor, L/kgTABLE 3-5\nPotential contaminated media and corresponding routes of exposure\nMedia Routes of potential exposure\nGroundwater Ingestion, dermal contact, inhalation during showering\nSurface water Ingestion, dermal contact, inhalation during showeringSediment Ingestion, dermal contactAir  Inhalation "}

They are not \nproducts of terms, that is CW is the parameter. It is not the product of C and W. \nSome examples of bio concentration factors are given in Table 3-6.\nTotal Exposure Assessment.  The evaluation of all major sources of exposure is \nknown as total exposure assessment (Butler et al., 1993). After reviewing the avail-able data, it may be possible to decrease or increase the level of concern for a particular route of entry to the body. Elimination of a pathway of entry can be jus-tified if:\n 1. The exposure from a particular pathway is less than that of exposure through \nanother pathway involving the same media at the same exposure point.\n 2. The magnitude of exposure from the pathway is low.\n 3. The probability of exposure is low and incidental risk is not high.\n There are two methods of quantifying exposure: point estimate methods and prob-\nabilistic methods. The EPA utilizes the point estimate procedure by estimating the reasonable maximum exposure (RME). "}
{"text": "Because this method results in very conserva-tive estimates, some scientists believe probabilistic methods are more realistic (Finley and Paustenbach, 1994).

For example, when calculating intake for the inhalation of airborne chemicals, an inhalation rate and exposure time are required. Specific equations for media and routes of exposure are given in Table 3-7. Standard values for use in the intake equations are shown in Table 3-8. The EPA has made some additional assumptions in calculating exposure that are not noted in the tables. In the absence of other data, the exposure frequency (EF) for residents is generally assumed to be 350 days/year to account for absences from the residence for vacations. Similarly, for workers, EF is generally assumed to be 250 days/year based on a 5-day workweek over 50 weeks per year.  Because the risk assessment process is considered to be an incremental risk for cancer, the exposure assessment calculation is based on an assumption that cancer effects are cumulative over a lifetime and that high doses a"}

Although the validity of this assumption may be debated, the standard risk calculation incorporates this assumption by using a lifetime exposure duration (ED) of 75 years and an averaging time (AT) of 27,375 d (that is 365 days/year 3  75 years). For noncarcinogenic effects, the averaging time \n(AT) is assumed to be the same as the exposure duration (ED) (Nazaroff and Alverez-Cohen, 2001).\n*The notation in Equation 3-10 and subsequent equations follows that used in EPA guidance documents.

{"text": "s102  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nExample 3-2. Estimate the lifetime average chronic daily intake of benzene from \nexposure to a city water supply that contains a benzene concentration equal to the drinking water standard. The allowable drinking water concentration (maximum con-taminant level, MCL) is 0.005 mg/L. Assume the exposed individual is an adult male who consumes water at the adult rate for 63 years* and is an avid swimmer who swims in a local pool (supplied with city water) three days a week for 30 minutes from the age of 30 until he is 75-years-old. As an adult, he takes a long (30-minute) shower every day. Assume that the average air concentration of benzene during the shower is 5 \u03bcg/m\n3 (McKone, 1987). From the literature, it is estimated that the dermal uptake \nfrom water is 0.0020 m3/m2/h (This is PC in Table 3-7. PC also has units of m/h or \ncm/h.) Direct dermal absorption during showering is no more than 1 percent of the available benzene because most of the water does not stay in contact with skin long enough (Byard, 1989).\nSolution.  From Table 3-5, we note that five routes of exposure are possible from the \ndrinking water medium: (1) ingestion, dermal contact while (2) showering and (3) swim-ming, (4) inhalation of vapor while showering, and (5) ingestion while swimming. We begin by calculating the CDI for ingestion (Equation 3-11):\n CDI 5(0.005 mg/L)(2.3 L/d)(365 d/y)(63 y)\n(78 kg)(75 y)(365 d)\n 51.24 31024 mgykg?d\nThe chemical concentration"}

The ingestion rate (IR) and body weight (BW) were selected from Table 3-8. The exposure averaging time of 365 days/year for 75 years is the EPA\u2019s generally accepted value as discussed on page 99. Equation 3-13 may be used to estimate absorbed dose while showering:\n AD5(0.005 mg/L)(1.94 m\n2)(0.0020 m/h)(0.50 h/event)\n(78 kg)(75 years)\n          3(1 event/d)(365 d/y)(63 y)(103 L/m3)\n(365 d/y)\n 51.04 31024 mg/kg ?d\nAs in the previous calculation, CW is the MCL for benzene.

A ratio of 0.001 does \nnot mean that there is a one in one thousand chance of an effect occurring. If the HI exceeds unity, there may be concern for potential noncancer effects. As a rule, the greater the value above unity, the greater the level of concern.

Namely, should the risk from a carcinogen that causes liver cancer be added to the risk from a compound that causes stomach cancer? The conservative approach is to add the risks.\nExample 3-3.

{"text": "cannot be achieved. There are risks in all societal decisions from driving a car to drinking water with benzene at the MCL concentration. Even banning the production of chemicals, as was done for PCBs, for example, does not remove those that already permeate our en-vironment. Risk management is performed to decide the magnitude of risk that is tol-erable in specific circumstances (NRC, 1983). This is a policy decision that weighs the results of the risk assessment against costs and benefits as well as the public accep-tance. The risk manager recognizes that if a very high certainty in avoiding risk (that is, a very low risk, for example, 10\n27) is required, the costs in achieving low concen-\ntrations of the contaminant are likely to be high. Unfortunately, there is very little guidance that can be provided to the risk man-ager. We know that people are willing to accept a higher risk for things that they expose themselves to voluntarily than for involuntary exposures, and, hence, insist on lower levels of risk, regardless of cost, for involuntary exposure. We also know that people are willing to accept risk if it approaches that for disease, that is, a fatality rate of 10\n26 \npeople per person-hour of exposure (Starr, 1969).\n3-5 CHAPTER REVIEW\nWhen you have completed studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following without the aid of your textbook or notes:\n 1.

Examples include agriculture, civil and environmental engineering, ecology, economics, law, and the social sciences. The rubric that encom-passes the activities of civil and environmental engineers is water resources engineer-ing. Water resources engineering may be divided into two major categories: hydrology \nand hydraulics. For civil and environmental engineers, hydrologic methods are used to answer the question How much water can be expected? Hydraulic methods are used to design the structures that withdraw, store, and convey water. This chapter is focused on an introduction to descriptive and quantitative hydrology. Hydraulic methods are the subject of other courses in traditional civil and environmental engineering curricula.\nApplications\nThis chapter will provide you with elementary tools to estimate the following:\n \u2022 Intensity, duration, and frequency of rainfall \u2022 Amount of rainfall that will runoff a parking lot or a small parcel of land  \u2022 Risk of floods or droughts \u2022 V olume of storage required for a retention pond or small reservoir \u2022 How much water can be supplied by wells\n4-2 FUNDAMENTALS\nThe Hydrologic Cycle\nThe global system that supplies and removes water from the earth\u2019s surface is known \nas the hydrologic cycle (Figure 4-1).

{"text": "h two processes: (1) evaporation and (2) transpiration.* As moist air rises, it cools. Eventually enough moisture accumulates and the mass cools sufficiently to nu-cleate (form small crystals) on microscopic particles. Sufficient growth causes the droplets or snowflakes to become heavy enough to fall as precipitation. As they fall on the earth\u2019s surface, the droplets either run over the ground into streams and rivers (surface runoff, or just runoff ) or percolate into the ground to form groundwater.\nSurface Water Hydrology\nPrecipitation.  Surface water hydrology begins before the precipitate hits the ground. The form the precipitate takes (rain, sleet, hail, or snow) is important. For example, about 100 mm of light fluffy snow is equivalent to about 10 mm of rain while 100 mm of heavy wet snow is equivalent to about 50 mm of rain. Other factors of importance are the size of the area over which the precipitation falls, the intensity of the precipita-tion, and its duration.\n*Transpiration is the process whereby plants give off water vapor through the pores of their leaves. The moisture \ncomes from the roots through capillary action.dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 111  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 111  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles112  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n Once the precipitation hits the ground, a n"}

If the soil is dry and/or porous, the precipitate may infiltrate into the ground or it may only \nwet the surface. This process and the process of wetting leaves and blades of grass is called interception. The precipitate may be trapped in small depressions or puddles. It \nmay remain there until it evaporates or until the depressions fill and overflow. And last but not least, it may run off directly to the nearest stream or lake to become surface water. The four factors (evaporation, infiltration, interception, and trapping) that re-duce the amount of direct runoff are called abstractions.\nStreamflow.  The water that makes up our streams and rivers is derived from two \nsources: direct runoff and groundwater exfiltration, or base flow, as it is more com-\nmonly called. Direct runoff is a consequence of precipitation. Base flow is the dry weather flow that results from the seepage of groundwater out of stream banks. The amount of water that reaches a stream is a function of the abstractions men-tioned above and the catchment area or watershed that feeds the stream. The water-shed, or basin, is defined by the surrounding topography (Figure 4-2). The perimeter of the watershed is called a divide. It is the highest elevation surrounding the water-shed. All of the water that falls on the inside of the divide has the potential to be shed into the streams of the basin e"}

As we mentioned earlier, part of the precipitation that falls on the soil may infiltrate. This water replenishes the soil moisture or is used by growing plants and returned to the atmosphere by transpiration. Water that drains down-ward below the root zone finally reaches a level at which all of the openings or voids in the earth\u2019s materials are filled with water. This zone is known as the zone of saturation.

The geologic formation \nthat bears the water is called an aquifer.  The upper surface of the zone of saturation, if \nnot confined by impermeable material, is called the water table  (Figure 4-3). The \naquifer is called a water table aquifer  or an unconfined aquifer.  Water will rise to the \nlevel of the water table in an unpumped water table well.\n The smaller void spaces in the porous material just above the water table may contain \nwater as a result of capillarity.

Because of the irregularities in underground deposits and in surface topog-\nraphy, the water table occasionally intersects the surface of the ground or the bed of a \nstream, lake, or ocean. At these points of intersection, groundwater moves out of the \naquifer. The place where the water table breaks the ground surface is called a gravity  \nor seepage spring  (Figure 4-3).\nPerched Water Table.   A perched water table is a lens of water held above the sur-\nrounding water table by an impervious layer. It may cover an area from a few hundred \nsquare meters to several square kilometers.\nArtesian (Confined) Aquifer.

When there is no constriction in the manome-\nter, the water level in each leg rises to the same height. If the left leg is raised, the in-\ncreased water pressure in that leg pushes the water up in the right leg until the levels are \nequal again. If the right leg is clamped shut then, of course, the water will not rise to the \nsame level. However, at the point where the clamp is placed, the water pressure will in-\ncrease.

{"text": "ermeable layers are called confining layers. Other names \ngiven to these layers are aquicludes if they are essentially impermeable, or aquitards if \nthey are less permeable than the aquifer but not truly impermeable. An aquifer between impermeable layers is called a confined aquifer. If the water in the aquifer is under pressure, it is called an artesian aquifer (Figure 4-3). The name \u201cartesian\u201d comes from the French province of Artois (Artesium in Latin) where, in the days of the Romans, water flowed to the surface of the ground from a well. Water enters an artesian aquifer at some location where the confining layers inter-sect the ground surface. This is usually in an area of geological uplift. The exposed sur-face of the aquifer is called the recharge area.  The artesian aquifer is under pressure \nfor the same reason that the pinched manometer is under pressure, that is, because the recharge area is higher than the bottom of the top aquiclude and, thus, the height of the water above the aquiclude causes pressure in the aquifer. The greater the vertical dis-tance between the recharge area and the bottom of the top aquiclude, the higher the height of the water, and the higher the pressure.\nPiezometric Surfaces.  If we place small tubes (piezometers) into an artesian aquifer \nalong its length, the water pressure will cause water to rise in the tubes much as the water in the legs of a manometer rises to a point of equilibrium.

{"text": "units of expression for the measurement of these terms are not con-\nsistent with one another. For example, the common unit of measure for precipitation, infiltration, evaporation, and transpiration is mm/h while the common unit of measure for storage, river flow, and runoff is m\n3/s. Because it is assumed that precipitation, in-\nfiltration, evaporation, and transpiration occur over the entire surface of the hydrologic system, we approximate the volumetric rate by multiplying the measurement (in units of length per unit time) by the surface area. The terms of the mass balance equation for the hydrologic equation may be  expanded to show their functional relationship to other physical phenomena. For ex-ample, the amount of runoff is a function of the characteristics of the surface (paved, cultivated, flat, steep-sloped). The amount of storage, for example, is a function of the type of soil or geological formation. These two aspects of the hydrologic equation are discussed in Sections 4-5 and 4-7. In the following paragraphs, we elaborate on the behavior of the other terms.\nInfiltration.  A typical infiltration curve is shown in Figure 4-7. This is the type of \ncurve that results when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration rate. Beginning in 1911, numerous researchers (for example, Green and Ampt, 1911; Horton, 1935; and Holton, 1961) developed empirical relationships for infiltration capacity based on this type of curve.

{"text": "ing air) result in large evaporation rates. You may note that the units for these expressions do not make much sense. This is because these are empiri-cal expressions developed from field data. The constants have implied conversion fac-tors in them. In applying empirical expressions, care must be taken to use the same units as those used by the author of the expression. Because the cost to obtain data for the mass transfer estimation method is quite substantial, the most common method for estimating evaporation from a free water body is by using an evaporation pan. In the United States, the Standard National Weather Service Class A Pan is used. It is 122 cm (4 ft) in diameter by 254 mm (10 in) \nin depth. It is filled with water to a depth of 203 mm (8 in). It is made of unpainted galvanized iron. To circulate air under the pan, it is mounted on a wooden platform 305 mm (1 ft) above the ground. In operation, the depth of water is measured with a hook gage in a stilling well. The evaporation is computed as the difference between measured levels with an ad-justment for precipitation between observations.  Because it has been observed that pan evaporation occurs more rapidly than from larger bodies of water, a pan coefficient is used to correct the reading. The pan coeffi-cient is the ratio of the evaporation from a water body and the pan. The pan coefficient ranges from 0.6 to 0.8, with an average of 0.7.

For lakes and reservoirs subject to significant transport of energy by water flowing into the water body (called advected energy), local pan-lake relationships are \nessential.

Errors in the range of 10 to 15 percent of annual estimates and up to 50 percent for monthly estimates have been reported (Gupta, 2008).\nExample 4-1.  Silk\u2019s Lake has a surface area of 70.8 ha.

Space: the average rainfall over the area\n 2. Intensity: how hard it rains\n 3. Duration: how long it rains at any given intensity\n 4. Frequency: how often it rains at any given intensity and duration\nPoint Precipitation Analysis\nData from a single nearby rain gage are often sufficiently representative to allow their \nuse in the design of small projects. The analysis of data from a single gage is called point precipitation analysis. Spatial analysis is much more complex and is left for more advanced courses.\nIntensity and Duration\nIntensity is a measure of how hard it rains. The units of measure are mm/h. It is computed from rainfall records by determining the accumulation of rain for a selected time interval:\n \u00a2p\n\u00a2t5p22p1\nt22t1 (conversion factor) (4-8)\nwhere p1 and p 2 are the accumulated precipitation in mm at times t1 and t 2. Because the \ntime interval is typically less than an hour, the conversion factor is typically 60 min/h. \nThe duration of precipitation is equal to t 2 2 t 1. \nFrequency from Probability Analysis \nAs we discussed in Chapter 3, the relative frequency of an event such as a coin toss is a probability. A rainfall of a given intensity for a given duration is such an event. The probability of a single rainfall event, say E\n1, is defined as the relative num"}
{"text": "ber of occur-\nrences of the event in a long period of record of rainfall events. Thus, P(E 1), the prob-\nability of rainfall event E 1, is n 1/N for n 1 occurrences of the same event in a record of \nN events if N  is sufficiently large. The number of occurrences of n1 is the frequency, \nand n 1/N is the relative frequency.\n P(E1) 5 0.10 implies a 10 percent chance each year that a rainfall event will \n \u201coccur.\u201d Because the probability of any single, exact value of a continuous variable is zero, \u201coccur\u201d also means the rainfall event will be reached or exceeded. Table 4-3 is the compilation of a partial series of rainfall events. Rather than a record of all rainfalls, it is a record of rainfall intensities above some practical mini-mum. It gives the frequency or number of times that a rainfall of given intensity and duration will be equaled or exceeded for the period of record. For example, looking at the first row in Table 4-3, one would expect seven rainfall events with an intensity of 160.0 mm/h or more and a duration of five minutes to occur in any 45-year period (1999 2 1954 5 45 years) in the Dismal Swamp.dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 124  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 124  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER RESOURCES ENGINEERING  125\n You should note two other facts about the table. First, the numbers in the tab"}
{"text": "le are \nalso ranks. If the rainfall events for 5-minute duration storms are arranged in de-\nscending order of intensity, then the seventh storm in the sequence or \u201cthe seventh-ranked\u201d storm has an intensity of 160.0 mm/h or more. We assume that the ranks are spaced evenly between the recorded ranks, that is, that intensity and rank are linear. Thus, for the fifth-ranked storm of 5-minute duration, by interpolation, we can esti-mate that it would have an intensity of 170.0 mm/h or more. The second fact that you should note is the ranks may be used to infer the prob-ability that a given intensity storm will be equaled or exceeded. Again, using the seventh-ranked storm, we may infer that rainfall intensities of 160.0 mm/h or greater will occur with a frequency of seven times in 45 years. An annual average probabil-ity of occurrence would be \n7\n4550.16, or 16 percent. Hydrologists and engineers often \nuse the reciprocal of annual average probability because it has some temporal  significance. The reciprocal is called the average  return period or average recurrence \ninterval (T ):\n T51\nAnnual average probability (4-9)\nFor the case of our seventh-ranked storm, the average return period of a 160.0 mm/h, 5-minute storm is 6.25 years. This means that we would expect a storm of 160.0 mm/h or greater once every 6.25 years on the average. Because the amount of reliable data available is limited,* it is customary to use Weibull\u2019s formula for calculating return period (Weibull, 1939):\n T5"}

The sources of energy are \n(1) absorbed solar radiation, (2) net long-wave radiation, (3) condensation of atmo-spheric water vapor, (4) convective heat transfer by the wind, and (5) conductive heat transfer from rain. The effectiveness of radiation in melting snow is dependent on its reflectivity or albedo. Fresh, clean snow will reflect between 75 and 95 percent of the radiation. Old snow may have an albedo between 40 and 70 percent. Convective heat transfer from air is only effective when strong winds bring large quantities of warm air in contact with the snow. If the vapor pressure of the air is greater than that of snow at 0\u00b0C, turbulence brings moisture that can condense on the snow surface. Because snowmelt is essentially a process of converting ice into water, the enthalpy of conden-sation (2.49 MJ/kg) melts ice (enthalpy of fusion 5  333 kJ/kg). The condensation of \n1 kg of moisture on the snow surface results in the melting of approximately 7.5 kg of snow water. Because rainfall is above 0\u00b0C, it also brings heat to snow. The depth of snowmelt water may be estimated from calorimetry as \n D\nsnowmelt 5PTw\n80 (4-15)\nWhere D snowmelt  5 depth of snowmelt water, mm\nP 5 rainfall depth, mm\nTw 5 wet bulb temperature, \u00b0C \nSnowmelt Estimation \nSnowmelt quantities cannot be measured "}
{"text": "directly. As a result, estimation techniques \nhave been developed for use in estimating runoff. The most comprehensive snowmelt estimation technique was developed by the U.S Army Corps of Engineers (1960). Their empirical equations were developed to estimate the depth of snowmelt in the western United States. The equations incorpo-rate the results of extensive studies and heat transfer theory. These equations express snowmelt as a function of radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure, wind speed, rain, and forest cover. Because the air temperature drops about 5.5\u00b0C per 1,000 m of eleva-tion, a number of zones are selected for evaluation. The melt in each zone is computed and the results are combined for the basin area. A simpler technique for estimating snowmelt is called the degree-day method. A \ndegree-day is defined as a departure of 1\u00b0 in mean daily temperature above 0\u00b0C. Thus, a day with a mean temperature of 4\u00b0C is said to have 4 melting degree days. A degree-day factor is used to calculate the depth of water from melting snow. The factor is de-termined by dividing the volume of streamflow produced by melting snow within a given time period by the total degree days for the period. For basins with little range in elevation, the degree-day factor will range between 2 and 7 mm/degree-day. Because snow melting is also a function of humidity, wind, and solar radiation, the degree-day factor will vary from day to day. There is no satisfactory simple method for areas with a w"}

The snow line moves with the season so that no \nsingle station can provide measurements of the melting snow.\n For basins with a wide range in elevation, a systematic method of observing the portion of the basin covered by snow and its depth is required. Satellite imaging is a powerful tool in providing these estimates. Data are derived from several regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The extent of snowpack can be determined from the visible band. The infrared band provides estimates of the water content. Alternatively, microwave remote sensing provides information on the extent of the snowpack and the water equivalent (Gupta, 2008).\nRain and snowmelt. Warm spring rain on a winter\u2019s snow accumulation is often an \nevent that results in flooding. While neither the rainfall event nor the depth of accumu-lated snow may be significant in terms of event return periods, the combination, cou-pled with saturated soil, often produces flooding equivalent to that of significant return periods.

How much of the precipitation that falls on a watershed reaches the stream or \nstorm sewer draining it?\n 2. How long does it take for the runoff to reach the stream or storm sewer?\n 3. How often does the runoff cause a flood?\nStream Gages\nStreamflow measurements are made by recording the height of the surface of the water above a reference datum at a location with a fixed geometry (known as a control section). \nThe control section allows the use of hydraulic equations to estimate the flowrate based on the depth of water above the reference datum. Several examples of control sections are illustrated at the text website: www.mhhe.com/davis. The elevation (stage ) readings are calibrated in terms of streamflow ( discharge). \nAt manual stations, readings are made from a graduated rod ( staff gage) placed in \nthe stream. At automatic recording stations, three components are required: a device to sense the water stage, a method of recording the stage, and a method of storing the data. One of the oldest systems that is still in use is the float and cable system (Figure 4-11). A stilling well (Figure 4-12) is used to minimize the effects of wave action and to protect the float from floating logs and other debris. Newer installations may use a bubble-gage sensor. This is a pressure actuated system in which an orifice at the end of a piece of tubing is located below the"}

However, there is no national data collection program in the world that collects sufficient data to satisfy all the design and decision-making needs for every watershed. The approaches currently in use to estimate runoff fall into four catego-ries (Gupta, 2008):\n \u2022 Hydrograph analysis: This is a comparison of precipitation and the resulting \nstreamflow record.\n \u2022 Correlation with meteorological data: Statistical techniques such as cross-\ncorrelation, regression analysis, and frequency analysis are used in this approach.\n \u2022 Correlation with hydrological data at another site: Stream gage data at one site \nmay have transferable value at a nearby site on the same stream. This may involve \nextrapolation or interpolation of information gathered at two stations.\n \u2022 Sequential data generation: Synthetic data are generated based on a time series \nthat includes a random component in this technique. \nFor this introductory discussion we have selected two elementary ways of estimating runoff from rainfall that fall into the first category. They are called the rational method and the unit hydrograph method. The rational method is used to determine the diame-ter of a storm sewer to carry the runoff from a small watershed. The unit hydrograph method provides the starting point for the design of a reten"}

This simplification is a major cause for criticism of the rational method. Despite the criticism, it is widely used for small urban projects. A good example for us to look at is a paved parking lot (Figure 4-13). If the rainfall on the lot continues for a long enough period at a constant intensity, at some time the system will reach steady state. At steady state each drop of water that falls on the watershed conceptually displaces a drop through the storm sewer. Thus, further rainfall at the same intensity does not increase the discharge at the storm sewer.

It is equal to the discharge \n(Qout in Figure 4-13). Mulvaney (1851) and others recognized that for a constant rainfall \nintensity the ratio of the volume of water that is discharged past a gauging station at the \noutlet of a watershed to the volume of water that falls on the watershed as precipitation is approximately a constant. This ratio is called the runoff coefficient.

These are restricted to urban settings. \nThe coefficients in Table 4-4 are applicable for storms with 5- to 10-year return peri-ods.

A graphical representation of the discharge of a stream at a single \ngaging station is called a hydrograph (Figure 4-15). As we mentioned earlier, during \nthe period between storms the base flow is a result of exfiltration of groundwater from the banks of the stream. Discharge from precipitation excess, that is, that which re-mains after abstractions, causes a hump in the hydrograph. This hump is called the direct runoff hydrograph (DRH).\n Obviously, any precipitation excess that occurs at the extremities of a watershed \nwill not be recorded at the basin outlet until some time lapse has occurred. As pre-cipitation continues, enough time elapses for the more distant areas to add to the dis-charge at the gaging station. The lag time of the peak and the shape of the DRH depend on the precipitation pattern and the characteristics of the basin (size, slope, shape, and storage capacity). The area under the DRH (volume of water discharged) will be larger for a water-shed with a large surface area than for one with a small area. Because the water will flow more quickly from a steeply sloped watershed, the lag time will be smaller than \nFIGURE 4-15 \nAn idealized hydrograph showing a uniform \nbase flow and a superimposed direct runoff hydrograph resulting from 1.0 cm of rainfal"}

{"text": "01145_pagefilesWATER RESOURCES ENGINEERING  139\nUnit Hydrograph Method.  While the rational formula provides an estimate of the \npeak discharge, it does not provide an estimate of the total volume of water discharged from a storm. The unit hydrograph method provides a technique for estimating the vol-ume of water discharged. A unit hydrograph (UH) is a DRH that results from a unit of precipitation excess over a watershed for a unit period of time. Although any unit depth may be selected (fathoms, furlongs, feet, hands, or cubits all would do), we have selected an excess of 1.0 cm after abstractions as a workable unit depth.* The presumption is that if you can determine an average UH, then you can approximate the DRH for any other rainfall excess over the same unit time by multiplying the UH ordinates by the amount of the rainfall excess (Sherman, 1932). For example, a 2.0-cm rainfall excess would yield a DRH with ordinates twice as large as a 1.0-cm UH. The method is limited to watersheds between 3,000- and 4,000-square kilometers in area (Viessman, et al., 1989). Because the intent of the UH is to portray discharge caused by direct runoff so we can use it to predict the DRH for other storms, the first step in constructing a UH is to remove the groundwater contribution. This step is called hydrograph separation. There are a number of graphical procedures for hydrograph separation. The second step in the construction of the UH is to estimate the total volume of water that occu"}
{"text": "rs as direct runoff. Because the hydrograph is a plot of discharge versus time, the area under the DRH is equal to the volume of direct runoff. The volume is computed by numerical integration of the area under the curve. This is simply a sum-mation of the products of an arbitrary unit of time ( Dt) and the height of the DRH or-\ndinate at the center of the selected time interval. The third step is to convert the volume of direct runoff to a storm depth of runoff. This is done by dividing the volume of direct runoff by the area of the watershed in square meters and then multiplying by a conversion factor of 100 cm/m.Qcc\nb\naQb\nQa\ntc\nTimeDischarge (Q)\ntb ta\n(a) Undeveloped (b) Partially developed (c) Fully developed\nFIGURE 4-17\nEffect of watershed development on a hydrograph.

Determine the unit hydrograph ordinates for the Triangle River hy-\ndrograph shown in Figure 4-18. The area of the watershed is 16.2 square kilometers.\nSolution.  The first step is to determine the depth of the storm precipitation spread \nover the watershed. The depth is equivalent to the volume of water divided by the area. The volume is equal to the area under the hydrograph. Because of the rather symmetrical shape of this particular hydrograph, it would be easy to find the area from the principles of geometry. However, in the interest of developing a technique that will also be applicable to more customary hydrographs, we will  numerically integrate the area under the curve. We do this by taking a convenient slice or Dt and \nmultiplying it by the height of the direct runoff (DRH) ordinate. The direct runoff ordinate is simply the difference between the total ordinate and the base ordinate. In this particular instance the base ordinate is, by observation, 2.0 m\n3/s for all time peri-\nods. Using a convenient time interval of 1 hour, the  following tabular computations are used to numerically integrate the area under the curve:\nTime  Total Base DRH V olume \ninterval (h) ordinate (m\n3/s) ordina"}

There are two fundamental assumptions in the technique. The first is that storms of the same unit duration have ordinates that are in proportion to the unit hydrograph ordinates. Thus, simple ratios can account for differences in run-off excess. The second assumption is that a sequence of storms may be approximated by superimposing one hydrograph over another (with appropriate time lag) and add-ing the ordinates together. This is illustrated in the next example.dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 142  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 142  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401"}

This is particularly important when analyzing a series of watersheds that contribute to a river or sewer at various distances downstream from the headwater. The coincident arrival of two peaks would influence the design dramatically.\nLag Time.  The time of arrival of the peak discharge is determined inherently in the \nUH method of estimating runoff. The lag time is the time from the midpoint of excess rainfall"}
{"text": " to the peak discharge as shown in Figure 4-15.\nTime of Concentration.  The time of concentration (t\nc) is the time required for direct \nrunoff to flow from the hydraulically most remote part of the drainage area to the water-\nshed outlet. One of the major assumptions of the rational method is that the average rainfall intensity used in Equations 4-19 and 4-20 has continued for a period long enough to  establish direct runoff and that rainfall has continued long enough to equal or exceed t\nc. Thus, it is impossible to use the rational formula without being able to estimate tc.\n Although there are several methods for estimating t c, the Federal Aviation Agency \nformula appears to be the easiest to use (FAA, 1970):\n tc51.8(1.1 2C)23.28D\n23S (4-21)\nwhere tc 5 time of concentration, min\nC 5 runoff coefficient\nD 5 overland flow distance, m\nS 5 slope, %xDischarge, m3/s\n10\n1 0 2345678920304050\nTime, hHydrograph \nfrom 2nd Hour\nHydrograph from\n3rd HourCompound Runoff Hydrograph\nxx xx x Hydrograph from\n1st Hour\nFIGURE 4-20\nCompound runoff hydrograph for Triangle River.

The \nestimate of the peak discharge using this time of concentration was shown in \n Example 4-5.\nEstimation of Probability of Occurrence\nThe frequency of occurrence (1/ T) used in the design of water supply or storm water \ncontrol projects should be a function of the cost of the project and the benefits to be obtained from i"}
{"text": "t. That is, the benefit-cost ratio should be greater than 1.0 to justify the project on economic grounds. While the cost of construction can be estimated in a straightforward manner, the environmental cost may be impossible to estimate. Like-wise, the benefit beyond a cheaper supply of water or a reduced amount of flood dam-age is difficult to quantify. The following paragraphs provide some guidance on the selection of a design frequency. They were obtained from the ASCE sewer design manual with their permis-sion (ASCE, 1969). In practice, benefit-cost studies usually are not conducted for the ordinary urban storm drainage project. Judgment supported by records of performance in other simi-lar areas is usually the basis of selecting the design frequency.dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 147  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 147  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles148  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The range of frequencies used in engineering offices is as follows:\n 1. For storm sewers in residential areas, 2 to 15 years, with 5 years most com-\nmonly reported.\n 2. For storm sewers in commercial and high-value districts, 10 to 50 years, de-pending on economic justification.\n 3. For flood protection works and reservoir design, economics usually dictate a 50-year return period.\nOther factors that may affect choice of des"}
{"text": "ign frequency include:\n 1. Use of greater return periods for design of those parts of the system not eco-nomically susceptible to future relief.\n 2. Use of greater recurrence intervals for design of special structures, such as expressway drainage pumping systems, where runoff exceeding capacity would seriously disrupt an important facility. Design frequencies of 50 years or more may be justified in such cases, particularly in small drainage areas, even though the project may be located in a district justifying only 5-year frequency for normal drainage.\n 3. Adoption of shorter return periods than normal but commensurate with avail-able funds so that some degree of protection can be provided.\nThe cost of storm sewers is not directly proportional to design frequency. Studies of ef-fects of various factors on sewer cost show that sewer systems designed for 10-year storms may cost only about 6 to 11 percent more than systems designed for 5-year storms, depending on the sewer slope (Rousculp, 1939). The lesser increase applies to steeper sewers. If the peak flow is estimated by the rational method, it is assumed that the return period (inverse probability) of the peak flow is the same as that of the rainfall used to obtain it. If you use the UH method to determine the discharge, you must resort to some other method of estimating the probability of occurrence.\nAnnual Series.  Extreme-value analysis is a probability analysis of the largest or \nsmallest values in a data set. Each of t"}

If the smallest value is used, it is \ncalled an annual minima series. Because of the climatic effects on most hydrologic phenomena, water year  or \nhydrologic year is adopted instead of a calendar year. The U.S. Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) has adopted the 12-month period from October 1 to September 30 as the hydrologic year for the United States. This period was chosen for two reasons (Boyer, 1964). \u201c(1) to break the record during the low-water period near the end of the summer season, and (2) to avoid breaking the record during the winter, so as to eliminate com-putation difficulties during the ice period.\u201ddav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 148  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 148  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles The procedure for an annual maxima or minima analysis is as follows:\n 1. Select the minimum or maximum value in each 12-month interval (October to \nSeptember) over the period of record.\n 2. Rank each value starting with the highest (for annual maxima) or lowest (for annual minima) as rank number one.\n 3. Compute a return period using Equation 4-10.\n 4.

Although the same paper may be used for an-nual minima series, Gumbel recommends a log extremal probability paper (axis of ordinates is log scale) for droughts (Gumbel, 1954).\nFrom the Gumbel plot, the return period for a flood or drought of any magnitude may be determined. Conversely, for any magnitude of flood or drought, you may determine how frequently it will occur. In statistical parlance a Gumbel plot is a linearization of a Type I probability distribution. The logarithmically transformed version of the Type I distribution is called a log-Pearson Type III distribution. The return period of the mean ( X) of the \nType I distribution occurs at T  5 2.33 years. Thus, the U.S.G.S. takes the return \nperiod of the mean annual flood to be 2.33 years.

Also determine the discharge of the mean monthly annual flood.\nSolution.  To begin we select the maximum discharge in each hydrologic year. The first nine months of 1969 and the last three months of 1990 cannot be used because they are not complete hydrologic years. After selecting the maximum value in each year, we rank the data and compute the return period. The 1970 water year begins in October 1969.\nThe computations are summarized in Table 4-6. The return period and flows are \nplotted as the solid line in Figure 4-21. From Figure 4-21 we find that the return period for a flood of 58.0 m\n3/s is about 9.2 years. The mean annual flood is about 37 m3/s.\nPartial-Duration Series.

To take these events into consideration, a partial series of the data is exam-\nined. The theoretical relationship between an annual series and partial series is shown in Table 4-7. The partial series is approximately equal to the annual series for return periods greater than ten years (Langbein, 1949). If the time period over which the event occurs is also taken into account, the analysis is termed a partial-duration series. While it is fairly easy to define a flood as \u201cany\u201d flow that exceeds the capacity of the drainage system, in order to properly define a drought we must specify the low flow and its duration. For example, if a roadway is covered with water for ten minutes, we can say that it is flooded. In contrast, if the flow in a river is below our deman"}
{"text": "d for ten minutes, we certainly would not declare it a drought! Thus, a partial-duration series is particularly relevant for low-flow conditions. From an environmental engineering point of view, three low-flow durations are of particular interest. The 10-year return period of seven days of low flow has been selected by many states as the critical flow for water pollution control. Wastewater treatment plants must be designed to provide sufficient treatment to allow effluent discharge without driving the quality of the receiving stream below the standard when the dilution capacity of the stream is at a 10-year low. A longer duration low flow and longer return period are selected for water supply. In the Midwest, durations of 1 to 5 years and return periods of 25 to 50 years are used in the design of water-supply reservoirs. Where water supply is by direct draft (withdrawal) from a river, the duration selected may be on the order of 30 to 90 days with a 10-year return period. The procedure for performing a partial-duration series analysis is very similar to that used for an annual series.\nComplete Series.  All of the observed data are used in a complete series analysis. \nThis analysis is usually presented in one of two forms: as a duration curve (Figure 4-22), or as a cumulative probability distribution function (CDF) (Figure 4-23).

Thus, \u201cAccumulated\u201d means sum of observations equal to or greater than the class interval. \u201cPercent\u201d is the percent of readings equal to or greater than the class interval, computed by dividing the cumulative sum for each class interval by the total number of observations and multiplying by 100 percent. The mean of each class interval is plotted against \u201cPercent\u201d in Figures 4-22 and 4-23. From these figures we find that a monthly flow of 28.0 m\n3/s is equaled or exceeded \nabout 10 percent of the time. The mean monthly discharge is the flow that is equaled or exceeded 50 percent of the time. From either Figure 4-22 or 4-23 we find that the mean monthly discharge is about 8 m\n3/s.\nWhen to Use Which Series. You should not expect that the probability of occurrence (1/T) computed from an annual series will be the same as that found from a complete se-\nries. There are many reasons for this difference: Among the most obvious is the fact that in an annual series we treat \n1/12 of the data as if it were all of the data when, in fact, it is not \neven a representative sample. It is only the extreme end of the possible range of values. The following guidelines can be used to decide when to use which analysis:\n 1. Use an annual series to predict the size of flood that a storm sewer or drainage \nchannel must handle.\n 2. "}
{"text": "Use a partial series to predict low-flow conditions for wastewater dilution and \nwater supply.\n 3. Use a complete series to determine the long-time reliability (safe yield) for \nwater supply or power generation.\nIn practice the complete-series analysis can be performed to decide whether or not it \nis worth doing a partial series for water supply. If the complete series indicates that the mean monthly flow will not supply the demand, then computation of a partial series to determine the storage requirement is not worth the trouble, since it would be impossible to store enough water.\n4-6 STORAGE OF RESERVOIRS\nClassification of Reservoirs\nFor our purpose we can classify reservoirs either by size or by use. The size of the \nreservoir is used to establish the degree of safety to be incorporated into the design of the dam and spillway. The use or uses of the reservoir are a basis for evaluating the benefit-cost ratio. Major dams (reservoir capacity greater than 6 3  10\n7 m3) are designed to withstand \nthe maximum probable flood. Intermediate-sized dams (1 3  106 to 6 3  107 m3) are de-\nsigned to handle the discharge from the most severe storm considered to be reasonably characteristic of the watershed. For minor reservoirs (less than 1 3 10\n6 m3) the dams \nare designed to handle floods with return periods of 50 to 100 years.dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 155  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 155  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk"}

The multipurpose or multiuse reservoir is the rule rather than the exception. Very seldom is it possible to justify the cost of a major reservoir on the basis of a single use.\nVolume of Reservoirs\nMass Diagram.  The techniques for determining the storage volume required for a reservoir are dependent both on the size and use of the reservoir. We shall discuss the simplest procedure, which is quite satisfactory for small water-supply impoundments, storm-water retention ponds, and wastewater equalization basins. It is called the mass diagram or Rippl method (Rippl, 1883). The main disadvantage of the Rippl method is that it assumes that the sequence of events leading to a drought or flood will be the same in the future as it was in the past. More sophisticated techniques have been de-veloped to overcome this disadvantage, but these techniques are left for more advanced classes. The Rippl procedure for determining the storage volume is an application of the mass balance approach (Equation 2-4). In this case it is assumed that the only input is the flow into the reservoir (Q\nin) and that the only output is the flow out "}
{"text": "of the reservoir \n(Qout). Therefore,\ndS\ndt5d(In)\ndt2d(Out)\ndt\nbecomes\n dS\ndt5Qin2Qout (4-22)\nwith the assumption that the density term cancels out because the change in density \nacross the reservoir is negligible. If we multiply both sides of the equation by dt, the inflow and outflow become \nvolumes (flow rate 3 time 5 volume), that is,\n dS5(Q\nin)(dt)2(Qout)(dt) (4-23)\nBy substituting finite time increments (Dt), the change in storage is then ( Q\nin)(\u00a2t)2(Qout)(\u00a2t)5\u00a2S (4-24)\nBy cumulatively summing the storage terms, we can estimate the size of the reservoir. \nIf the reservoir design is for water supply, then Q out is the demand, and zero or positive \nvalues of storage (DS) indicate there is enough water to meet the demand. If the stor-age is negative, then the reservoir must have a capacity equal to the absolute value of cumulative storage to meet the demand. If the reservoir design is for flood protection, then Q\nout is the capacity of the downstream river to hold water, and zero or negative \nvalues indicate the river is below flood stage. If the storage is positive, then the reser-voir must have capacity equal to the cumulative storage to prevent flooding.dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 156  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 156  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER RESOURCES ENGINEERING  157\nExample 4-12.

When existing storm sewers cannot handle run-\noff, consideration is given to providing a retention basin (storage pond) as an alterna-tive to replacing the existing storm sewer. The retention basin serves two functions. First, it delays the coincidence of peak flows, and second, it can be designed to release \nstorm water at a rate the storm sewer can handle. The procedure for applying the mass diagram to retention basins is basically the same as it is for water supply. The DRH for the design storm is substituted for the monthly discharge readings. The allowable dis-charge to the existing sewer is substituted for Q\nout.\n Wastewater treatment plants function best when the flow into the plant is constant. The general daily fluctuation in water use in most municipalities and industries results in an alternating pattern of high and low wastewater discharge. The peaks and valleys of flow can be evened out with an equalization basin. The volume of the equalization basin is chosen to shave off the peaks and fill in the valleys of the inflow mass diagram.\n4-7 GROUNDWATER AND WELLS\nAlthough the portion of the population of the United States supplied by surface water is 58 percent greater than that supplied by groundwater, the number of communities supplied by groundwater is almost 12 times that supplied by surface water (Figure 4-24). The reason for this pattern is that larger cities are supplied by surface water while many small communities use groundwater.\nFIGURE 4"}

It dissolves naturally occurring minerals, which may give the water undesirable characteristics such as hardness, red color from iron oxides, and toxic contaminants such as arsenic.\nConstruction of Wells\nModern wells consist of more than a simple hole in the ground (Figure 4-25). A steel pipe called a casing is placed in the well hole to maintain the integrity of the hole. The casing is sealed to the surrounding soil with a cement grout, and a screen is placed at the bottom of the casing to allow water in and to keep soil material out. Two types of pump may be used. In the diagram shown, the pump motor is at the ground surface and the pump itself is placed down in the well above the well screen.

In this case both the pump and the motor are lowered into the cas-\ning; water is pumped out of the well through a discharge pipe or drop pipe.\nSanitary Considerations.  The penetration of a water-bearing formation by a well \nprovides a direct route for possible contamination of the groundwater. Although there are different types of wells and well construction, there are basic sanitary aspects that must be considered and followed (refer to Figure 4-26):\n 1. The annular space outside the casing should be filled with a watertight cement \ngrout or puddled clay from the surface to the depth necessary to prevent entry of contaminated water. A minimum of 6 m is recommended.\n 2. For artesian aquifers, the casing should be sealed into the overlying imperme-able formations so as to retain the artesian pressure.\n 3. When a water-bearing formation containing water of poor quality is pene-trated, the formation should be sealed off to prevent the infiltration of water into the well and aquifer.\nFIGURE 4-26\nSanitary considerations in well construction.Steel CasingHighes t\nFlood\nLevelPumpDischargePipe\nSanitaryWellSeal\nConcretePad\n0.1 m 0.6 m\n6 m0.6 m\nGroutSealdav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 161  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 161  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles162  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n 4.

Every well should be provided with an overlapping, tight- fitting cover at the top of the casing or pipe sleeve to prevent contaminated water or other material from entering the well. The seal in a well that is exposed to possible flooding should be elevated at least 0.6 m above the highest known flood level. When this is not possible, the seal should be watertight and equipped with a vent line whose opening to the atmosphere is at least 0.6 m above the highest known flood level. Well covers and pump platforms should be elevated above the adjacent finished ground level. Pumproom floors should be constructed of reinforced, watertight con-crete sloped away from the well so that surface and wastewater cannot stand near the well. The minimum thickness of such a slab or floor should be 0.1 m. Concrete slabs or floors should be poured separately from the grout formation seal and, where the threat of freezing exists, insulated from it and the well casing by a plastic or mastic coating or sleeve to prevent bonding of the concrete to either. All water wells should be readily accessible at the top for inspection, servicing, and testing. This requires that any structure over the well be easily removable to pro-vide full, unobstructed access for well-servicing equipment.\nDisinfectio"}

Every well should be disinfected promptly after construction or repair.\nPumphousing.  A pumphouse installed above the surface of the ground should be \nused. It should be unnecessary to use an underground discharge connection if an insu-lated, heated pumphouse is provided. For individual installations in rural areas, two 60-watt light bulbs, a thermostatically controlled electric heater, or a heating cable will generally provide adequate protection when the pumphouse is properly insulated.  Because power failures may occur, an emergency gasoline-driven power supply or pump should be considered.\nCone of Depression\nWhen a well is pumped, the level of the piezometric surface in the vicinity of the well will be lowered (Figure 4-27). This lowering, or drawdown, causes the piezometric surface to take the shape of an inverted cone called a cone of depression. Because the water level in a pumped well is lower than that in the aquifer surrounding it, the water flows from the aquifer into the well. At increasing distances from the well, the draw-down decreases until the slope of the cone merges with the static water table. The dis-tance from the well at which this occurs is called the radius of influence. The radius of influence is not constant but tends to expand with continued pumping. At a given pumping rate, the s"}

Deeper and narrower cones will form in fine sand or sandy clay \n(Figure 4-28). As the pumping rate increases, the drawdown increases. Consequently the slope of the cone steepens. When other conditions are equal for two wells, it may be expected that pumping costs will be higher for the well surrounded by the finer material because of greater drawdown. When the cones of depression overlap, the local water table will be lowered (Figure 4-29). This requires additional pumping lifts to obtain water from the interior \nportion of the group of wells. A wider distribution of the wells over the groundwater basin will reduce the cost of pumping and will allow the development of a larger quan-tity of water. One rule of thumb is that two wells should be placed no closer together than two times the thickness of the water-bearing strata. For more than two wells, they should be spaced at least 75 meters apart.\nDefinition of Terms\nThe aquifer parameters identified and defined in this section are those relevant to de-termining the a"}

The percentage of water that is free to drain from the aquifer under \nthe influence of gravity is defined as specific yield (Figure 4-30). Specific yield is not equal to porosity because the molecular and surface tension forces in the pore spaces keep some of the water in the voids. Specific yield reflects the amount of water avail-able for development. Some values are shown in Table 4-9.\nStorage Coefficient (S).  This parameter is akin t"}
{"text": "o specific yield. The storage coeffi-\ncient is the volume of available water resulting from a unit decline in the piezometric surface over a unit horizontal cross-sectional area. It has units of m\n3 of water/m3 of \naquifer or, in essence, no units at all! Storage coefficient and specific yield may be used interchangeably for unconfined aquifers. Values of S  for unconfined aquifers range from \n0.01 to 0.35. For confined aquifers the values of S  vary from 1 3  10\n23 to 1 3  1025.\nHydraulic Gradient and Head.   The slope of the piezometric surface is called the \nhydraulic gradient. It is measured in the direction of the steepest slope of the piezo-metric surface. Groundwater flows in the direction of the hydraulic gradient and at a rate proportional to the slope. The vertical distance from a reference plane (zero datum) to the bottom of a well or piezometer (Figure 4-31) is called the elevation head. The height to which water \nwill rise in the piezometer is called the pressure head.  The sum of the elevation head \nand the pressure head is called the total head. Using Figure 4-31 and the assumption that the groundwater is flowing in the plane of the page, we can define the gradient to be:\n Hydraulic gradient 5Change in head\nHorizontal distance (4-25)Static Water\nLevel\nReduced Water\nLevel\nWater Drained by\nGravity from 1\ncubic meter of Soil\nSpecific Yield = (100%)Volume Water\nVolume Soil1 m1 m\n1 m\nFIGURE 4-30\nSpecific yield.

In 1856 he dis-covered that the velocity of water flow in a porous aquifer was proportional to the hy-draulic gradient. He proposed the following equation, which is now called Darcy\u2019s law (Darcy, 1856):\n y5K\n dh\ndr  (4-27)\nwhere     y 5 velocity, m/s\n          K  5 hydraulic conductivity, m/s\n      d h /dr 5 slope of the hydraulic gradient, m/m\n The Darcy velocity is not a real velocity because it assumes that the full cross- \nsectional area of the aquifer is available for water to flow through. However, much of the cross-sectional area is soil material; thus, the actual area through which the water flows is much less. As a result, the actual linear velocity of the groundwater is consid-erably faster than the Darcy velocity. We may determine the actual average linear velocity by taking into account the fraction of the cross-sectional area filled with soil. Let us define the flow (Q ) to be \nthe product of the total cross-sectional area and the Darcy velocity, that is Q 5 Ay. \nThe actual average linear velocity (y 9) through the voids times the area of the voids \n(A9) is also equal to the flow (Q ). Thus, "}

Steady \nstate is a condition under which no changes occur with time. It will seldom, if ever, oc-cur in practice, but may be approached after very long periods of pumping. Transient-flow equations include a factor of time. The derivation of these equations is based on the following assumptions:\n 1. The well is pumped at a constant "}

Water is released from the aquifer in immediate response to a drop in the piezometric surface.\nSteady Flow in a Confined Aquifer.  The equation describing steady, confined aquifer flow was first presented by Dupuit in 1863 (Dupuit, 1863) and subsequently extended by Thiem (1906).

You should note that the r term used to calculate the value of u may take on values ranging upward from the radius of the well. Thus, you could if you wished, calculate every point on the cone of depression (i.e., value of s) by iterating the calculation with values of r from the well radius to infinity. If you wish to calculate the drawdown at a specific distance from the pumping well, then, of course, you must use that distance for r.

{"text": "ere is no exact solution to the transient-\nflow problem for unconfined aquifers because T changes with time and r as the water table is lowered. Furthermore, vertical-flow components near the well  invalidate the assumption of radial flow that is required to obtain an analytical solution. If the uncon-fined aquifer is very deep in comparison to the drawdown, the transient-flow solution for a confined aquifer may be used for an approximate solution.

Two special cases of inhomogeneity are of particular interest. The first case is where the cone of depression intercepts a barrier. This is shown in Figure 4-35.

The components of the evaluation of the aquifer as a water supply \nare: (1) depth to the bottom of the aquiclude; (2) elevation of the existing piezometric surface; (3) drawdown for sustained pumping at the design rate of demand; and (4) recharge and drought implications. The depth to the bottom of the aquiclude sets the limit of drawdown of the piezo-metric surface. If the piezometric surface drops below the bottom of the aquiclude, ground settlement will begin to occur and, in addition to structural failure of the well, structural damage will occur to buildings and roadways. In populated areas of the United States, regulatory agencies gather hydrogeologic data reported by well drillers and others that may be used to estimate the depth to the aquiclude. In less densely populated areas, exploration a"}
{"text": "nd evaluation by a professional hydrogeologist is required. The existing piezometric surface sets the upper bound of the range of drawdown. That is, the difference between the existing piezometric surface and the bottom of the aquiclude (s\nmax in Figure 4-33a) is the maximum allowable drawdown for a safe yield. \nAs noted above, in populated areas, regulatory agencies will have a database that includes this information. Otherwise, a hydrogeologic exploration will be required.\nFIGURE 4-37\nInterference drawdown of three wells.dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 181  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 181  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles182  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The maximum sustainable pumping rate is found by setting h 1 equal to the height \nof the aquifer (D in Figure 4-33a) and h 2 equal to the height of the piezometric surface \nbefore pumping (H  in Figure 4-33a). If the required Q cannot be achieved using one \nwell for the design flow, multiple wells may be required. Except for very small de-\nmands, this is the rule rather than the exception. Multiple wells may be used to take advantage of the fact that wells will \u201crecover\u201d their original piezometric surface when pumping ends if there is adequate water in the aquifer. Thus, if the cones of depression of multiple wells do not interfere with one another, the "}
{"text": "wells can be operated on a schedule that allows them to recover. Theoreti-cally, if the nonpumping time equals the pumping time, the recovery will be complete (Brown, 1963).\nUnconfined Aquifer.   The components of the evaluation of the aquifer as a water \nsupply are: (1) depth of the aquifer; (2) annual precipitation and resultant aquifer re-\ncharge; and (3) drawdown for sustained pumping at the design rate of demand. The depth of the aquifer for an unconfined aquifer is measured from the static, un-pumped, water level to the underlying impermeable layer (Figure 4-33b). In theory, the depth of the aquifer sets one dimension of the maximum extent of pumping. When the water level is lowered to the impermeable layer, the well \u201cdrys up.\u201d In actuality, this depth cannot be achieved because of other constraints. In populated areas, regulatory agencies have data that permit estimation of the depth of the aquifer. In less densely populated areas, exploration and evaluation by a professional hydrogeologist is required.\nAquifer Recharge.  A hydrologic mass balance is used to estimate the potential volume \nof water that recharges the aquifer. An annual time increment rather than the shorter monthly periods used in surface water analysis may be used for estimation purposes be-cause the aquifer behaves as a large storage reservoir. Under steady-state conditions, the storage volume compensates for dry seasons with wet seasons. Thus, like the analysis of reservoirs, a partial duration serie"}
{"text": "s analysis for drought durations of 1 to 5 years with return periods of 25 to 50 years is used in evaluation of an unconfined aquifer as a water source. Even though vast quantities of water may have accumulated in the aquifer over geologic time periods, the rate of pumping may exceed the rate of replenishment. Even with very deep aquifers where the well does not dry up, the removal of water results in removal of subsurface support. This, in turn, results in loss of surface elevation or land subsidence. Although this occurs in nearly every state in the United States, the San Joaquin Valley in California serves as a classic example. Figure 4-38 is a dramatic photograph showing the land surface as it was in 1977 in relation to its location in 1925. The distance between the 1925 sign and the 1977 sign is approximately 9 m.\nGroundwater Contamination\nThe well hydraulics equations may be used to design purge or extraction wells to remove contaminated groundwater. The lowering of the piezometric surface will cause contami-nants to flow to the well where they may be removed to the surface for treatment. In some cases, a well field may be required to intercept the contaminant plume. In these cases, the well interference effects may be put to good use in designing the distribution of the wells. The use of extraction wells is discussed in Chapter 12.dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 182  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466dav01145_ch04_110-215.indd Page 182  10/3/11  1:29 PM user-f466 volumes/203/M"}

When the authors of the equations present them in professional journals they \nare careful to state the assumptions used in their development. Often the assumptions \ncannot be completely met in actual situations. The models must be recognized as ap-\nproximations to real-world behavior.\n In some applications of the models unrealistic or even impossible results may be \nobtained. For example, the well drawdown in Equation 4-34 or any of the other well \nequations may be calculated to be below the bottom of the well! An understanding of \nthe physical situation must be employed to evaluate the results of the calculations. This \nis called engineering judgment . Prudence in the application of models is always war-\nranted. This is true not only for the well equations but for all engineering models.\nFIGURE 4-38\nLand subsidence in the San \nJoaquin Valley,  16 km south-\nwest of Mendota, CA.

For most engineering students, studying chemistry is not what they had hoped to be doing during their engineering studies, but chemistry is the basis for many of the environmental problems that engineers must solve in this field. Mastering this topic will be a great help in understanding, and solving, environmental engineering challenges. Water chemistry is important in the design of water and wastewater processes and in the remediation of environmental pollution, to give two examples"}
{"text": ". Of particular importance in water chemistry studies is the understanding of alkalinity chemistry, which, to a great extent, allows animals and plants to thrive. Natural alkalinity in the environment maintains the waters of the world\u2014surface water, ground water, and oceans\u2014at a near neutral pH thereby preventing them from becoming too acidic or too basic. When you jump in a lake to go swimming you don\u2019t even think about getting acid burns! It\u2019s the alkalinity balance of the environment that prevents that from happe ning. That same balance prevents many contaminants from dissolving into the \nwater, which protects animal and plant life. In water environmental engineering we rely heavily on this phenomenon not only to protect water sources but also to treat water to render it potable or more aesthetically acceptable for consumption or to treat waste streams for discharge into the environment. Another important aspect of water chemistry is that when we treat water we often have to add chemicals to react with impurities that are present and remove them or render them harmless. To do that, one needs to know how much of a chemical and what type of chemical should be added. Therefore a fundamental understanding of units for calculating doses is critical, as well as understanding basic reactions that determine how chemicals combine. Many contaminants are removed by adding a chemical that reacts with the contaminant to form a solid particle that can then be physically removed from the"}
{"text": " water. These are referred to as precipitation reactions , \nwhich are described in the coming sections. Some contaminants may be rendered harmless, acceptable to be left in the water, or will form a solid species if their oxida-tion state is changed. For example, iron in a plus 2 state (Fe\n12) is very soluble but \nwhen converted to a plus 3 state (Fe13) it tends to precipitate under natural condi-\ntions. Hence, chemistry associated with changing the oxidation state of compounds in water is important, and is referred to as redox reactions. Another important factor as-sociated with using these precipitation reactions and redox reactions to treat water is a need to understand how long the reaction takes to occur so that if we are designing a tank for the reaction to take place we know how big to make it. The section on reac-tion kinetics addresses this concept. Finally, some contaminants in water are volatile and can be removed from the water by transferring them to the air. Of course, this method of treating water is only acceptable if the contaminant in air does not pose a health threat. Generally, the amount of a volatile contaminant removed from water and dispersed into the air is at a low enough concentration to be acceptable or it can be removed from the air prior to discharge. The last section of the chapter deals with phase transfer from water to air.

Density is a measure of the concentration of matter and is expressed in three ways:\n 1. Mass density, r. Mass density is mass per unit volume and is measured in \nunits of kg/m3. Appendix A, Table A-1, shows the variation of density with \ntemperature for pure water free from air. Dissolved impurities change the den-\nsity in direct proportion to their concentration and their own density. In envi-ronmental engineering applications, it is common to"}
{"text": " ignore the density increase due to impurities in the water. However, environmental engineers do \nnot ignore the density of the matter when dealing with high concentrations, such as thickened sludge or commercial liquid chemicals.\n 2. Specific weight, \ng. Specific weight is weight (force) per unit volume, mea-\nsured in units of kN/m3. The specific weight of a fluid is related to its density \nby the acceleration of gravity, g, which is 9.81 m/s2.\n g5rg (5-1)\n 3. Specific gravity, S. Specific gravity is given by\n S5r/r05g/g0 (5-2)\n  where the subscript zero denotes the density of water at 3.98\u00b0C, 1,000 kg/m3, \nand the specific weight of water, 9.81 kN/m3.\n For quick approximations, the density of water at normal temperature is taken as 1,000 kg/m\n3 (which is conveniently 1 kg/L) with a specific gravity 5 1.00.\n All substances, including liquids, exhibit a resistance to movement, an internal friction. The higher the friction, the harder it is to pump the liquid. A measure of the friction is viscosity. Viscosity is presented in one of two ways:\n 1. Dynamic viscosity, or absolute viscosity, m , has dimensions of mass per unit \nlength per time, with units of Pa ? s. Dynamic viscosity represents a measure \nof a fluid\u2019s internal resistence to flow. This is an important factor in the analysis of liquid flow, for example in designing pumps. dav01145_ch05_216-249.indd Page 218  14/10/11  12:34 AM user-f466dav01145_ch05_216-249.indd Page 218  14/10/11  12:34 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ"}

Kinematic viscosity, y, is found by\n y5m/r (5-3)\n  and has dimensions of length squared per time with the corresponding units m2/s.\n This is an alternative numerical expression of the properties of a fluid. It is often \nused to evaluate the friction coefficient for flow in pipes.\nStates of Solution Impurities\nFrom an environmental engineering point of view, substances can exist in water in one of three classifications\u2014suspended,  colloidal, or dissolved.\n A dissolved substance is one that is truly in solution. The substance is homoge-neously dispersed in the liquid. Dissolved substances can be simple atoms or com-plex molecular compounds. Dissolved substances are in the liquid, that is, there is only one phase present. The substance cannot be removed from the liquid without accomplishing a phase change such as distillation, precipitation, adsorption, extrac-tion, or passage through \u201cionic\u201d pore-sized membranes. In distillation either the liq-uid or the substance itself is changed from a liquid phase to a gas phase in order to achieve separation. In precipitation the substance in the liquid phase combines with \nanother chemical to form a solid phase, thus achieving separation from the water. Adsorption also involves a phase change, wherein the dissolved substance reacts with a solid particle to form a solid particle-substance complex. "}
{"text": "Liquid extraction  \ncan separate a substance from water by extracting it into another liquid, hence a phase change from water to a different liquid. A membrane with pore sizes in the ionic-size range can separate dissolved substances from the solution by a high-pressure filtering process. Suspended solids are large enough to settle out of solution or be removed by  filtration. In this case there are two phases present, the liquid water phase and the  suspended-particle solid phase. The lower size range of this class is 0.1 to 1.0m m, \nabout the size of bacteria. In environmental engineering, suspended solids are de-fined as those solids that can be filtered by a glass fiber filter disc and are properly called filterable solids. Suspended solids can be removed from water by physical methods such as sedimentation, filtration, and centrifugation. Colloidal particles are in the size range between dissolved substances and sus-pended particles. They are in a solid state and can be removed from the liquid by physical means such as very high-force centrifugation or filtration through mem-branes with very small pore spaces. However, the particles are too small to be re-moved by sedimentation or by normal filtration processes. Colloidal particles exhibit the Tyndall effect; that is, when light passes through a liquid containing colloidal particles, the light is reflected by the particles. The degree to which a colloidal sus-pension reflects light at a 90 8 angle to the entrance beam is"}
{"text": " measured by turbidity.  \nTurbidity is a relative measure, and there are various standards against which a sam-ple is compared. The most common standard is a nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). For our purposes we will simply refer to the measure of turbidity as a turbidity unit (TU). For a given particle size, the higher the turbidity, the higher the concentration of colloidal particles.dav01145_ch05_216-249.indd Page 219  14/10/11  12:34 AM user-f466dav01145_ch05_216-249.indd Page 219  14/10/11  12:34 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles220  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n Another useful term in environmental engineering that is used to describe a solu-\ntion state is color. Color is not separate from the above three categories, but rather is a combination of dissolved and colloidal materials. Color is widely used in environ-mental engineering because it, in itself, can be measured. However, it is very difficult to distinguish \u201cdissolved color\u201d from \u201ccolloidal color.\u201d Some color is caused by col-loidal iron or manganese complexes, although the most common cause of color is from complex organic compounds that originate from the decomposition of organic matter. One common source of color is the degradation of soil humus, which pro-duces humic acids. Humic acids impart reddish-brown color to the water. Humic ac-ids have molecular weights between 800 and 50,0"}
{"text": "00, the lower being dissolved and the greater, colloidal. Most color seems to be between 3.5 and 10m m, which is col-\nloidal. Color is measured by the ability of the solution to absorb light. Color particles can be removed by the methods discussed for dissolved or colloidal particles, depend-ing upon the state of the color. True color is a term used to describe the color after turbidity has been removed. Figure 5-1 presents an overview by size of the types of particles that are often dealt with in water treatment. A technique that is being used in water treatment to help evaluate water quality is particle counting. A particle counter counts the number of particles in a water sample and reports the results by particle size, generally from 1 to 30m m. Figure 5-2 shows a sample count comparing the distribution of particles in \na raw water to that of the finished water. While particle counting does not indicate anything about the kind of particle, it can be useful in assessing overall treatment efficiency as well as characterizing water sources.Colloidal colorHumic acids\nFlocculated particlesSuspended particlesColloidsCryptosporidium cystsVirusesBacteria\nGiardia cystsFungiAlgae\nPost-filtered particles\n0.01 0.1 1.0 10\nSize, micrometers, /H9262m20 30 40 100\nFIGURE 5-1\nParticulates in water.

In order to perform stoichiometric calculations,* it is nec-\nessary to convert to common units, and the terms molarity and normality are used. Weight percent, P, is sometimes employed to express approximate concentrations \nof commercial chemicals or of solid concentrations of sludges. The term specifies the grams of substance per 100 grams of solution and is mathematically expressed as\n P5W\nW1W03100%  (5-4)\nwhere  P 5 percent of substance by weight\n  W  5 grams of substance\n W 0 5 grams of solution\n Analysts generally give results directly in mass per volume (concentration), and the \nunits are mg/L. In environmental engineering it is often assumed that the substance does not change the density of the water. This is generally untrue, but it does make for some useful conversions, and the assumption is not too inaccurate for dilute concentra tions. \n*Stoichiometry is the part of chemistry concerned with measuring the proportions of elements involved in a reac-\ntion. Stoichiometric calculations are an application of the principle of conservation of mass to chemical reactions.\nPercent (%) Distribution\n01234567\nSize, /H9262m8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 >1660\n5040302010\n0Total number of particles > 1 /H9262m\nRaw = 44,000/mL\nFilt"}

A water treatment plant produces 100 kg of dry weight of by-product \nmaterial, called sludge, per day. That sludge is removed from the treatment process in \n10 m3 of water. What is the actual percent solids and the approximate mg/L concentration \nassuming the density of water does not change?\nSolution.

Note that \nthe error increases as the amount of dry solids increases. This is because the density of water increases as more solids are added and the approximation no longer holds. Typi-cally, the density change must be accounted for when the solute concentration exceeds 10 percent.\n In order to work with chemical reactions it is necessary to convert weight con-\ncentrations to molarity or normality.

The value of n  depends on how the molecule reacts. In this text we are concerned \nwith molecules that react in acid/base reactions or precipitation reactions. In an \nacid/base reaction, n is the number of hydrogen ions that the molecule transfers. \nThat is, an acid gives up an EW of hydrogen ions, and a base accepts an EW of hy-drogen ions. In a precipitation reaction, n  is the valence of the element in question. \nFor compounds, n is equal to the number of hydrogen ions that would be required \nto replace the cation; that is, for CaCO\n3 it would take two hydrogen ions to replace \nthe calcium, therefore, n 5 2. In oxidation/reduction reactions, n is equal to the \nchange in oxidation number that the compound undergoes in the reaction. Obvi-ously, it is difficult to recognize reaction capacity without the context of the reaction. Common valence states of elements found in water are listed in Appendix A.

Any change in the system components to the right of CO 2 causes the \nCO 2 either to be released from solution or to dissolve.\n We can examine the character of the buffer system in resisting a change in pH by as-suming the addition of an acid or a base and applying the law of mass action (Le Chatelier\u2019s principle). For "}
{"text": "example, if an acid is added to the system, it unbalances it by increasing the hydrogen ion concentration. Therefore, the carbonate combines with it to form bicarbon-\nate. Bicarbonate reacts to form more carbonic acid, which in turn dissociates to CO\n2 and \nwater. The excess CO 2 can be released to the atmosphere in a thermodynamically open \nsystem. Alternatively, the addition of a base consumes hydrogen ions and the system moves to the right with the CO\n2 being replenished from the atmosphere. When CO 2 is \nbubbled into the system or is removed by passing an inert gas such as nitrogen through the liquid (a process called stripping), the pH will change more dramatically because the atmosphere is no longer available as a source or sink for CO\n2. Figure 5-3 summarizes the \nfour general responses of the carbonate buffer system. The first two cases are common in natural settings when the reactions proceed over a relatively long period of time. In a water treatment plant, we can alter the reactions more quickly than the CO\n2 can be re-\nplenished from the atmosphere. The second two cases are not common in natural set-tings. They are used in water treatment plants to adjust the pH. In natural waters in equilibrium with atmospheric CO\n2, the amount of CO22\n3 in so-\nlution is quite small in comparison to the HCO2\n3 in solution.

Above a pH of 12.3, essentially all of the carbonate species are present as \nCO22\n3, and the alkalinity equals 2[CO22\n3]1[OH2]. The [OH2] may not be \ninsignificant at this pH.\n Figure 5-4 schematically shows the change of species described above as the pH \nis lowered by the addition of acid to a water containing alkalinity. Note that the pH starts at above 12.3 and as acid is added the pH drops slowly as the first acid (H\n1) \n addition is consumed by free hydroxide (OH2), preventing a significant pH drop, and \nthen the acid is consumed by carbonate (CO22\n3) being converted to bicarbonate \n(HCO2\n3). At about pH 8.3 the carbonate is essentially all converted to bicarbonate, at \nwhich point there is another somewhat flat area where the acid is consumed by con-\nverting bicarbonate to carbonic acid. From Equation 5-37 and our discussion of buffer solutions, it can be seen that al-kalinity serves as a measure of buffering capacity. The greater the alkalinity, the greater the buffering capacity. In environmental engineering, then, we differentiate between alkaline water and water having high alkalinity. Alkaline water has a pH greater than 7, while a water with high alkalinity has a high buffering capacity. An alkaline water may or may not have a high buffering capacity. Likewise, a water with a high alkalin-ity may or may not have a high pH. By convention, alkalinity is"}

Some \nexamples include disinfection of water, gas transfer into and out of water, removal of organic matter from water, and radioactive decay. The study of how these reactions proceed is called reaction kinetics. The rate of reaction, r, is used to describe the rate \nof formation or disappearance of a compound. Reactions that take place in a single phase (tha"}
{"text": "t is, liquid, gas, or solid) are called homogeneous reactions. Those that occur at surfaces between phases are called heterogeneous. For each type of reaction, the rate \nmay be defined as follows: For homogeneous reactions\n r5Moles or milligrams\n(Unit volume)(Unit time) (5-41)\n For heterogeneous reactions r5Moles or milligrams\n(Unit surface)(Unit time) (5-42)\n Production of a compound results in a positive sign for the reaction rate ( 1r), \nwhile disappearance of a substance yields a negative sign ( 2r). Reaction rates are a \nfunction of temperature, pressure, and the concentration of reactants. For a stoichio-\nmetric reaction of the form:\naA1bBScC\nwhere a, b, and c  are the proportionality coefficients for the reactants A, B, and C, the change \nin concentration of compound A is equal to the reaction rate equation for compound A:\n d[A]\ndt5rA52 k[A]a [B]b5k[C]g (5-43)\nwhere [A], [B], and [C] are the concentrations of the reactants, and a, b, and g are em-\npirically determined exponents. The proportionality term, k, is called the reaction rate \nconstant. It is often not a constant but, rather, is dependent on the temperature and pressure. Since A and B are disappearing, the sign of the reaction rate equation is nega-tive. It is positive for C because C is being formed. The order of reaction is defined as the sum of the exponents in the reaction rate \nequation. The exponents may be either integers or fractions. Some sample reaction orders are shown in Table 5-4.\nTABLE 5-4\nExampl"}

The form of the graph is determined from the result of integration of the equa-tions in Table 5-4. The integrated forms and the appropriate graphical forms are shown in Table 5-5.\n5-6 GAS TRANSFER\nAn important example of time-dependent reactions is the mass transfer (dissolution or volatilization) of gas from water. In 1924 Lewis and Whitman  postulated a two-film theory to describe the mass transfer of gases. According to their theory, the boundary between the gas phase and the liquid phase (also called the interface) is composed of \ntwo"}
{"text": " distinct films that serve as a barrier between the bulk phases (Figure 5-5). For a molecule of gas to go into solution, it must pass through the bulk of the gas, the gas \nfilm, the liquid film, and into the bulk of the liquid (Figure 5-5 a). To leave the liquid, \nthe gas molecule must follow the reverse course (Figure 5-5b ). The driving force \ncausing the gas to move, and hence the mass transfer, is the concentration gradient: C\ns 2 C. Cs is the saturation concentration of the gas in the liquid, and C  is the actual \nconcentration. When Cs is greater than C, the gas will go into solution. When C  is \ngreater than C s, the gas will desorb.

{"text": "ilesWATER TREATMENT   251\n6-1 INTRODUCTION\nApproximately 80 percent of the United States population turn their taps on every day \nto take a drink of publicly supplied water. They all assume that when they take a drink it is safe. They probably never even think of safety. There are approximately 170,000 public water systems in the United States. EPA classifies these water systems according to the number of people they serve, the source of their water, and whether they serve the same customers year-round or on an occa-sional basis. The following statistics are based on information in the Safe Drinking \nWater Information System (SDWIS), for the fiscal year ended September 2000, as reported to EPA by the states (U.S. EPA, 2000). Public water systems provide water for human consumption through pipes or other \nconstructed conveyances to at least 15 service connections or serve an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year. EPA has defined three types of public water systems:\n \u2022 Community Water System (CWS): A public water system that supplies water to \nthe same population year-round.\n \u2022 Non-Transient Non-Community Water System (NTNCWS): A public water sys-\ntem that regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six \nmonths per year, but not year-round.

Figure 6-1 shows the  incidence of typhoid cases in Philadelphia from 1890 to 1935. This is typical of the  decrease in  waterborne disease as public water supply treatment has increased. Philadelphia received its water from rivers and distributed the water untreated until about 1906, when slow sand filters were put into use. An immediate reduction in typhoid fever was realized. Disinfec-tion of the water by the addition of chlorine further  decreased the number of typhoid cases. A still greater decrease was accomplished after 1920 by careful control over in-fected persons who had become carriers. Since 1952 the death rate from typhoid fever in the United States has been less than 1 per 1,000,000. Many countries and organizations have committed their technological and financial resources to developing nations in rec-ognition of the principle that reasonable access to safe and adequate drinking water is a fundamental right of all people. Advances in public health tracking in the United States, and the more acute aware-ness of waterborne illnesses from a variety of organisms, have contributed to a better understanding of the link between water quality and illness.

Between 1971 and 2006, 780 outbreaks of waterborne disease were reported in the United States (WQ&T, 2011) as shown in  Figure 6-2a . Many of these illnesses are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms \n(diarrhea, fatigue, cramps). Table 6-1 shows the number of illnesses caused by various agents. Of those 418,819 cases, 403,000 cases are attributed to one outbreak of crypto-sporidiosis in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1993. It was estimated that 403,000 people became sick and 50 deaths occurred among severely immunocompromised  individuals during this outbreak. At the time, the city complied with all water quality regulations. In 2006, EPA passed new regulations to address cryptosporidiosis.

In contrast, no statistically significant change over time was observed in the annual proportion of treatment deficiencies involv-ing groundwater in public systems. Inadequate or interrupted disinfection was the pri-mary treatment deficiency for groundwater systems.  A water that can be consumed in any desired amount without concern for adverse health effects is termed a potable water. Potable does not necessarily mean that the water "}
{"text": "tastes good. This is in contrast to a palatable water, which is one that is pleasing to drink, but not necessarily safe. We have learned that we must provide a water that is both potable and palatable, for if it is not palatable people will turn to untreated water that may not be potable. The widespread availability of potable water in the United States does not mean that there are no operational or control deficiencies in water systems, especially in smaller systems. The scientific community is continually mak-ing advances in identifying contaminants and discovering potential long-term health effects of constituents that had not been previously identified.\nWater Quality\nPrecipitation in the form of rain, hail, or sleet contains very few impurities. It may contain trace amounts of mineral matter, gases, and other substances as it forms and falls through the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The precipitation, however, has virtually no bacte-rial content (U.S. PHS, 1962).\n Once precipitation reaches the earth\u2019s surface, many opportunities are presented for the introduction of mineral and organic substances, microorganisms, and other forms of pollution (contamination).* When water runs over or through the ground surface, it may pick up particles of soil. This is noticeable in the water as cloudiness or turbidity. It also picks up particles of organic matter and bacteria. As surface water seeps downward into the soil and through the underlying material to the water table, most of the suspende"}
{"text": "d par-ticles are filtered out. This natural filtration may be partially effective in removing bacteria and other particulate materials. However, the chemical characteristics of the water may change and vary widely when it comes in contact with mineral deposits. As surface water seeps down to the water table, it dissolves some of the minerals contained in the soil and rocks. Groundwater, therefore, often contains more dissolved minerals than surface water. The following four categories are used to describe drinking water quality:\n 1. Physical: Physical characteristics relate to the quality of water for domestic \nuse and are usually associated with the appearance of water, its color or tur-\nbidity, temperature, and, in particular, taste and odor.\n 2. Chemical: Chemical characteristics of waters are sometimes evidenced by \ntheir observed reactions, such as the comparative performance of hard and soft waters in laundering. Most often, differences are not visible.\n*Pollution as used in this text means the presence in water of any foreign substances (organic, inorganic, radio-\nlogical, or biological) that tend to lower its quality to such a point that it constitutes a health hazard or impairs the usefulness of the water.dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 255  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 255  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles256"}

Microbiological: Microbiological agents are very important in their relation \nto public health and may also be significant in modifying the physical and \nchemical characteristics of water.\n 4. Radiological: Radiological factors must be considered in areas where there is a \npossibility that the water may have come in contact with radioactive substances. The radioactivity of the water is of public health concern in these cases.\n Consequently, in the development of a water supply system, it is necessary to  examine carefully all the factors that might adversely affect the intended use of a water supply source.\nPhysical Characteristics\nTurbidity.  The presence of suspended material such as clay, silt, finely divided or-ganic material, plankton, and other particulate material in water is known as turbidity. \nThe unit of measure is a Turbidity Unit (TU) or Nephlometric Turbidity Unit (NTU). It is determined by reference to a chemical mixture that produces a reproducible re-fraction of light. Turbidities in excess of 5 TU are easily detectable in a glass of water and are usually objectionable for aesthetic reasons. Clay or other inert suspended particles in drinking water may not adversely affect health, but water containing such particles may require treatment to make it suitable for its intended use. Following a rainfall, variations in the groundwater turbidity may be considered an indication of surface or other introduced pollution."}
{"text": "\nColor.  Dissolved organic material from decaying vegetation and certain inorganic \nmatter cause color in water. Occasionally, excessive blooms of algae or the growth of aquatic microorganisms may also impart color. While color itself is not usually objec-tionable from the standpoint of health, its presence is aesthetically objectionable and suggests that the water needs appropriate treatment.\nTaste and Odor.  Taste and odor in water can be caused by foreign matter such as \norganic compounds, inorganic salts, or dissolved gases. These materials may come from domestic, agricultural, or natural sources. Drinking water should be free from any objectionable taste or odor at point of use.\nTemperature.  The most desirable drinking waters are consistently cool and do not \nhave temperature fluctuations of more than a few degrees. Groundwater and surface water from mountainous areas generally meet these criteria. Most individuals find that water having a temperature between 1082158C is most palatable.\nChemical Characteristics\nChloride.  Most waters contain some chloride. The amount present can be caused by the leaching of marine sedimentary deposits or by pollution from sea water, brine, or industrial or domestic wastes. Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/L usually produce a noticeable taste in drinking water. Domestic water should contain less than 100 mg/L of chloride. In some areas, it may be necessary to use water with a dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 256  13/10/11"}

In these cases, all of the other criteria for \n water purity must be met.\nFluoride.  In some areas, water sources contain natural fluoride. Where the concen-\ntrations approach optimum levels, beneficial health effects have been observed. In such areas, the incidence of dental caries has been found to be below the levels  observed in areas without natural fluoride. The optimum fluoride level for a given area depends upon air temperature, since temperature greatly influences the amount of water people drink. Excessive fluoride in drinking water supplies may produce fluorosis \n(mottling) of teeth, which increases as the optimum fluoride level is exceeded.* State or local health departments should be consulted for their recommendations, but  acceptable levels are generally between 0.8 and 1.3 mg/L fluoride.\nIron.  Small amounts of iron frequently are present in water because of the large \namount of iron in the geologic materials. The presence of iron in water is considered objectionable because it imparts a brownish color to laundered goods and affects the taste of beverages such as tea and coffee.\nLead.  Exposure of the body to lead, however brief, can be seriously damaging to \nhealth. Prolonged exposure"}
{"text": " to relatively small quantities may result in serious illness or death. Lead taken into the body in quantities in excess of certain relatively low \u201cnormal\u201d limits is a cumulative poison.\nManganese.  Manganese imparts a brownish color to water and to cloth that is washed in it. It flavors coffee and tea with a medicinal taste.\nSodium.  The presence of sodium in water can affect persons suffering from heart, \nkidney, or circulatory ailments. When a strict sodium-free diet is recommended, any water should be regarded with suspicion. Home water softeners may be of particular concern because they add large quantities of sodium to the water. (See Section 6-3 for an explanation of the chemistry and operation of softeners).\nSulfate.  Waters containing high concentrations of sulfate, caused by the leaching of \nnatural deposits of magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) or sodium sulfate (Glauber\u2019s salt), may be undesirable because of their laxative effects.\nZinc.  Zinc is found in some natural waters, particularly in areas where zinc ore de-\nposits have been mined. Zinc is not considered detrimental to health, but it will impart an undesirable taste to drinking water.\nArsenic.  Arsenic occurs naturally in the environment and is also widely used in timber \ntreatment, agricultural chemicals (pesticides), and manufacturing of gallium arsenide wafers, glass, and alloys.

Nitrates (NO 3), cyanides (CN), and heavy metals con-\nstitute the major classes of inorganic substances of health concern. Methemoglobinemia \n(infant cyanosis or \u201cblue baby syndrome\u201d) has occurred in infants who have been given water or fed formula prepared with water having high concentrations of nitrate. CN ties up the hemoglobin sites that bind oxygen to red blood cells. This results in oxygen depri-vation. A characteristic symptom is that the patient has a blue skin color. This condition is called cyanosis. CN causes chronic effects on the thyroid and central nervous system. The toxic heavy metals include arsenic (As), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), and silver (Ag). The heavy metals have a wide range of effects. They may be acute poisons (As and Cr\n61 for example), or they \nmay produce chronic disease (Pb, Cd, and Hg for example).\nToxic Organic Substances.   There are over 120 toxic organic compounds listed on \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Priority Pollutant List. These include \npesticides, insecticide"}
{"text": "s, and solvents. Like the inorganic substances, their effects may be acute or chronic.\nMicrobiological Characteristics\nWater for drinking and cooking purposes must be made free from disease-producing organisms ( pathogens). These organisms include viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and hel-\nminths (worms). Some organisms which cause disease in people originate with the fecal discharges of infected individuals. Others are from the fecal discharge of animals. Unfortunately, the specific disease-producing organisms present in water are not easily identified. The techniques for comprehensive bacteriological examination are complex and time-consuming. It has been necessary to develop tests that indicate the relative degree of contamination in terms of an easily defined quantity. The most widely used test estimates the number of microorganisms of the coliform group. This \ngrouping includes two genera: Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes. The name of the group is derived from the word colon. While E. coli are common inhabitants of \nthe intestinal tract, Aerobacter are common in the soil, on leaves, and on grain; on oc-casion they cause urinary tract infections. The test for these microorganisms, called the Total Coliform Test, was selected for the following reasons:\n 1. The coliform group of organisms normally inhabits the intestinal tracts of \nhumans and other mammals. Thus, the presence of coliforms is an indication \nof fecal contamination of the water.\n 2. Even in acutely ill ind"}
{"text": "ividuals, the number of coliform organisms excreted in \nthe feces outnumber the disease-producing organisms by several orders of magnitude. The large numbers of coliforms make them easier to culture than disease-producing organisms.\n 3. The coliform group of organisms survives in natural waters for relatively long \nperiods of time, but does not reproduce effectively in this environment. Thus, the presence of coliforms in water implies fecal contamination rather than growth of the organism because of favorable environmental conditions. These dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 258  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 258  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER TREATMENT   259\norganisms also survive better in water than most of the bacterial pathogens. \nThis means that the absence of coliforms is a reasonably safe indicator that pathogens are not present.\n 4. The coliform group of organisms is relatively easy to culture. Thus, laboratory \ntechnicians can perform the test without expensive equipment.\nCurrent research indicates that testing for Escherichia coli specifically may be war-\nranted. Some agencies prefer the examination for E. coli as a better indicator of \n biological contamination than total coliforms. The two protozoa of most concern are Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium  oocysts. \nBoth pathogens are carried by animals in"}

Both are associated with gastrointestinal illness.\nRadiological Characteristics\nThe development and use of atomic energy as a power source and the mining of radio-active materials, as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials, have made it necessary to establish limiting concentrations for the intake into the body of radioac-tive substances, including drinking water. The effects of human exposure to radiation or radioactive materials are harmful, and any unnecessary exposure should be avoided. Humans have always been exposed to natural radiation from water, food, and air. The amount of radiation to which the individual is normally exposed varies with the amount of background radioactivity. Water with high radioactivity is not normal and is confined in great degree to areas where nuclear industries are situated.\nWater Quality Standards\nPresident Ford signed the National Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) into law on  December 16, 1974. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was directed to estab-lish maximum contaminant levels  (MCLs) for public water systems to prevent the occur-\nrence of any known or anticipated adverse health effects with an adequate margin of safety. EPA defined a public water system to be any system that provides piped water for human consumption, if such a system has at least 15 service connections or regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at le"}
{"text": "ast 60 days out of the year. This definition includes private businesses, such as service stations, restaurants, motels, and others that serve more than 25 persons per day for greater than 60 days out of the year. From 1975 through 1985, the EPA regulated 23 contaminants in drinking water supplied by public water systems. These regulations are known as interim primary drinking water regulations (IPDWRs). In June of 1986, the SDWA was amended. The amendments required EPA to set maximum contaminant level goals  (MCLGs) and \nMCLs for 83 specific substances. This list included 22 of the IPDWRs (all except tri-halomethanes). The amendments also required EPA to regulate 25 additional contami-nants every three years beginning in January 1991 and continuing for an indefinite period of time. Had EPA met these statutory requirements, the number of regulated contaminants would have exceeded 250 in 2007. Figure 6-3 shows the timetable of the number of contaminants that have been regulated as of 2006.dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 259  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 259  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles260  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The SDWA was amended again in 1996. These amendments contained four basic \nelements: (1) a new standard-setting process with language on how to select contami-nants for regulation; (2) s"}
{"text": "pecific deadlines to regulate certain contaminants such as arsenic, sulfate, radon, and disinfection by-products; (3) new state programs for source water assessments, capacity development, operator certification, and a revolving loan fund; and (4) new public information programs. Table 6-2 lists each regulated contaminant and summarizes its adverse health  effects. Some of these contaminant levels are being considered for revision. The nota-tion \u201cTT\u201d in the table means that a treatment technique is specified rather than a con-taminant level. The treatment techniques are specific processes that are used to treat the water. Some examples include coagulation and filtration, lime softening, and ion exchange. These will be discussed in the following sections.\nLead and Copper.  In 1991, EPA issued regulations for lead and copper, and estab-\nlished a monitoring program and a treatment technique for both. The MCL action \nlevels are 0.015 mg/L for lead and 1.3 mg/L for copper. Compliance with the regulations is also based on the quality of the water at the consumer\u2019s tap. Monitoring is required by means of collection of first-draw samples at residences. If the action level is exceeded, steps must be taken under this treatment technique to reduce the levels. The SDWA amendments forbid the use of pipe, solder, or flux that is not lead-free in the installation or repair of any public water system or in any plumbing system pro-viding water for human consumption.

The disinfectants used to \ndestroy pathogens in water and the by-products of the reaction of these disinfectants \nwith organic materials in the water are of potential health concern. One class of DBPs\u00a0has been regulated since 1979. This class is known as trihalomethanes (THMs). THMs are formed when a water containing an organic precursor is chlorinated  (precursor means forerunner). In this case it means an organic compound capable of \nreacting to produce a THM. The precursors are natural organic substances formed from the decay of vegetative matter, such as leaves, and aquatic organisms. THMs are of concern  because they are potential carcinogens and may cause reproductive effects. The four THMs that were regulated in the 1979 rules are: chloroform (CHCl\n3), bromo-\ndichloromethane (CHBrCl 2), dibromochloromethane (CHBr 2Cl), and bromoform \n(CHBr 3). Of these four, chloroform appears most frequently and is found in the highest \nconcentrations; however, the brominated compounds may have a higher health risk. The D-DBP rule was developed through a negotiated rule-making process, in which individuals representing major in"}
{"text": "terest groups concerned with the rule (for  example, public-water-system owners, state and local government officials, and envi-ronmental groups) publicly work with the EPA representatives to reach a consensus on the contents of the proposed rule. The D-DBP rule was implemented in stages. Stage 1 of the rule was promulgated in November 1998. Stage 2 was promulgated in 2006. Maximum residual disinfectant level goals (MRDLGs) and maximum residual disinfectant levels (MRDLs) were established for chlorine, chloramine, and chlorine dioxide (Table 6-3). Because ozone reacts too quickly to be detected in the distribution system, no limits on ozone were set. The MCLGs and MCLs for the disinfection by-products are listed in Table 6-4. In addition to regulating individual compounds, the D-DBP rule set levels for two groups of compounds: HAA5 and TTHMs. These groupings were made to recognize the  potential cumulative effect of several compounds. HAA5 is the sum of five haloacetic acids (monochloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, monobromo-acetic acid, and dibromoacetic acid). TTHMs (total trihalomethanes) is the sum of the concentrations of chloroform (CHCl\n3), bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl 2), dibro-\nmochloromethane (CHBr 2Cl), and bromoform (CHBr 3).\n The D-DBP rule is quite complex. In addition to the regulatory levels shown in the tables, levels are established for precursor removal. The amount of precursor required to be removed is a function of the alkalinity"}

Therefore, THM and HAA5 are continuously increas-ing until the point of maximum formation is reached. In order to better determine the level of DBPs consumed at the tap, compliance with the regulation is based on collect-ing samples in the distribution system. Although the number of samples can vary, it is in the range of four distribution samples collected quarterly for each treatment plant. In the Stage 1 rule, the sample points (say, four) are averaged over four quarters of data (so 16 data points are averaged) to determine compliance with the MCLs of Table 6-4. This method of determining compliance is called a running annual average (RAA). For the Stage 2 rule, several changes were made to the number and lo"}
{"text": "cations of the sam-ples, but also the method to calculate compliance was changed. In Stage 2, the four quarters from an individual sample site are averaged and each site must be below the MCLs. This is referred to as a locational running annual average (LRAA). Although the MCLs in Stage 1 and Stage 2 are the same, because of the use of the LRAA, com-pliance is more difficult in the Stage 2 rule. Also, the number of compliance sites is determined by the system population and is not set at four as in Stage 1.\nSurface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR).  The Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) and its companion rules, the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR) and the Long-Term Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rules (LT1ESWTR and LT2ESWTR), set forth primary drinking water regulations requiring treatment of surface water supplies or groundwater supplies under the direct influence of surface water. The regulations require a specific treatment technique\u2014filtration and/or disinfection\u2014in lieu of establishing maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for turbidity, Cryptosporidium, TABLE 6-4\n Maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs) and maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for disinfection by-products (DBPs)         \n       Stage 1   Stage 2      \n MCLG MCL  MCL\nContaminant mg/L mg/L mg/L\nBromate   Zero   0.010       \nBromodichloromethane   Zero          \nBromoform   Zero          \nChloral hydrate   0.005          \nChlorite   0.3   1.0       \nChloroform   0.07          \nDibromochlorome"}

The regulations also  establish a \nmaximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) of zero for Giardia, Cryptosporidium,  viruses, and Legionella. No MCLG is established for heterotrophic plate count or turbidity.\nTurbidity Limits.  Treatment by conventional or direct filtration must achieve a turbid-\nity level of less than 0.3 NTU in at least 95 percent of the samples taken each month. Those systems using slow sand filtration must achieve a turbidity level of less than 5 NTU at all times and not more than 1 NTU in more than 5 percent of the samples taken each month. The 1 NTU limit may be increased by the state up to 5 NTU if it deter-mines that there is no significant interference with disinfection. Other filtration tech-nologies may be used if they meet the turbidity requirements set for slow sand filtration, provid"}
{"text": "ed they achieve the disinfection requirements and are approved by the state. Turbidity measurements must be performed on representative samples of the sys-tem\u2019s filtered water every four hours or by continuous monitoring. For any system us-ing slow sand filtration or a filtration treatment other than conventional treatment, direct filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration, the state may reduce the monitoring requirements to once per day.\nDisinfection Requirements.   Filtered water supplies must achieve the same disinfec-\ntion as required for unfiltered systems (that is, 99.9 or 99.99 percent removal, also \nknown as 3-log and 6-log removal or inactivation, for Giardia and viruses respectively) through a combination of filtration and application of a disinfectant. Giardia and viruses are both fairly well inactivated by chlorine, and hence with \nproper physical treatment and chlorination both can be controlled. Cryptosporidium,  \nhowever, is resistant to chlorination. Depending on the source water concentration, EPA established levels of treatment, both additional physical barriers and disinfection techniques, that must be used to reduce the rush of illness due to Cryptosporidium.  \nOzone and ultraviolet light are effective disinfectants for Cryptosporidium.\nTotal Coliform.  On June 19, 1989, the EPA promulgated the revised National Primary \nDrinking Water Regulations for total coliforms, including fecal coliforms and E.\u00a0coli.  \nThese regulations apply to all public water sys"}

Larger systems that are required to col-lect at least 40 samples per month cannot obtain coliform-positive results in more than 5 percent of the samples collected each month to stay in compliance with the MCL. Smaller systems that collect fewer than 40 samples per month cannot have coliform-positive results in more than one sample per month. The EPA will accept any one of the five analytical methods noted below for the determination of total coliforms:\nMultiple-tube fermentation technique (MTF)Membrane filter technique (MF)Minimal media ONPG-MUG test (colilert system) (MMO-MUG)Presence-absence coliform test (P-A)Colisure techniquedav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 267  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 267  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles268  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n Regardless of the method used, the standard sample volume required for total co-\nliform testing is 100 mL.

Potable water is most conveniently classified as to \nits source, that is, groundwater or surface water. Generally, groundwater is uncon-\ntaminated but may contain aesthetically or economically undesirable impurities. However, groundwaters can be influenced by man-made spills and become contami-nated. Surface water must be considered to be contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or inorganic substances that could present a health hazard.

A sand aquifer between the shallow well supply and the surface watercourse may act as an effective filter for removal of organic matter and as a heat  exchanger for buffering temperature changes. To predict water quality from shallow wells, careful studies of the aquifer and nature of recharge water are necessary. EPA classifies some shallow wells as surface water. Surface water supplies are classified as to whether they come from a lake, reser-voir, or river. A comparison of lakes and rivers is shown in Table 6-7. Generally, a river has the lowest water quality and a lake the highest. Water quality in rivers depends upon the character of the watershed. River quality is largely influenced by pollution (or lack thereof) from municipalities, industries, and agricultural practices. The char-acteristics of a river can be highly variable. During rains or periods of runoff, turbidity may increase substantially. Many rivers will show an increase in color and taste and in odor-producing compounds. In warm months, algal blooms frequently cause taste and odor problems.TABLE 6-6\n General characteristics of groundwater and surface water       \nGround   Surface      \nConstant composition   Varying composition    \nHigh mineralization   Low mineralization    \nLittle turbidity   High turbidity    \nLow or "}

Addition-\nally, the quiescent conditions will reduce both the turbidity and, on occasion, the color. As in rivers, summer algal blooms can create taste and odor problems in lakes and reservoirs. While the averages are similar for rivers and lakes, rivers can have much higher extremes, with turbidities going into the hundreds. \nTreatment Systems.  Treatment plants can be classified as simple disinfection, filter \nplants, or softening plants. Plants employing simple chlorination are usually groundwa-\nter sources that have a high water quality and chlorinate to ensure that the water reach-ing customers contains safe bacteria levels.  A groundwater source can contain naturally occurring contaminants such as arse-nic, fluoride, radionuclides, iron, or manganese.  In this case the water may be treated by adsorption, ion-exchange or precipitation processes to remove the contaminant. Gr"}

These contaminants are generally removed by aeration, because many of the contaminants are volatile, or by adsorption.

In a filtration plant, rapid mixing, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disin-fection are employed to remove color, turbidity, taste and odors, organic matter, and bacteria. Additional operations may include bar racks or coarse screens if floating de-bris and fish are a problem. Figure 6-4 shows a typical flow diagram of a filtration plant.

The objective of flocculation is to allow the flocs \nto collide and \u201cgrow\u201d to a settleable size. The particles are removed by gravity (sedimen-tation). This is done to minimize the amount of solids that are applied to the filters. For treatment works with a high-quality raw water, it may be possible to omit sedimentation and perhaps flocculation. This modification is called direct filtration. Filtration is the  final polishing (removal) of particles. During filtration the water is passed through sand or similar media to screen out the fine particles that will not settle. Disinfection is the  addition of chemicals (usually chlorine) to kill or reduce the number of pathogenic organisms. Storage may be provided at the plant or located within the community to meet peak demands and to allow the plant to operate on a uniform schedule. The high-lift pumps provide sufficient pressure to convey the water to its ultimate destination. The precipitated chemicals, original turbidity, and suspended material are removed from the sedimentation basins and from the filters. These residuals must be disposed of properly. "}

In a softening plant (a typical flow diagram is shown in Figure 6-5), the design considerations of the various facilities are different than those in filtration. Also the chemical doses are much higher in softening, and the corre-sponding sludge production is greater. During rapid mix, chemicals are added to react with and precipitate the hardness. Precipitation occurs in the reaction basin. The other unit operations are the same as in a filtration plant except for the additional recarbonation step employed in softening to adjust the final pH.

The object of coagulation (and subsequently flocculation) is to turn the small par-ticles of color, turbidity, and bacteria into larger flocs, either as precipitates or sus-pended particles. These flocs are then conditioned so that they will be readily removed in subsequent processes. Technically, coagulation applies to the removal of colloidal particles. However, the term has been applied more loosely to removal of dissolved ions, which is actually precipitation. Coagulation in this chapter will refer to colloid removal only. We define coagulation as a method to alter the colloids so that they will \nbe able to approach and adhere to each other to form larger floc particles.\nColloid Stability\nBefore discussing colloid removal, we should understand why the colloids are sus-pended in solution and can\u2019t be removed by sedimentation or filtration. Very simply, the particles in the colloid range are too small to settle in a reasonable time period, and too s"}
{"text": "mall to be trapped in the pores of a filter. For colloids to remain stable they must remain small. Most colloids are stable because they possess a negative charge that re-pels other colloidal particles before they collide with one another.* The colloids are continually involved in Brownian movement, which is merely random movement. Charges on colloids are measured by placing DC electrodes in a colloidal dispersion. The particles migrate to the pole of opposite charge at a rate proportional to the poten-tial gradient. Generally, the larger the surface charge, the more stable the suspension.\nColloid Destabilization\nColloids are stable because of their surface charge. In order to destabilize the particles, we must neutralize this charge. Such neutralization can take place by the addition of an ion of opposite charge to the colloid. Since most colloids found in water are negatively charged, the addition of sodium ions (Na\n1) should reduce the charge. Figure 6-6 shows \nsuch an effect. The plot shows surface charge as a function of  distance from the colloid for no-salt (NaCl) addition, low-salt addition, and high-salt addition. As we would have predicted, the higher the concentration of sodium we add, the lower the charge, and therefore the lower the repelling forces around the colloid. If, instead of adding a monovalent ion such as sodium, we add a divalent or trivalent ion, the charge is re-duced even faster, as shown in Figure 6-7. In fact, it was found by Schulze and Hardy (Sc"}
{"text": "hulze, 1882, 1883; Hardy, 1900a, 1900b) that one mole of a trivalent ion can reduce the charge as much as 30 to 50 moles of a divalent ion and as much as 1,500 to 2,500 moles of a monovalent ion (often referred to as the Schulze-Hardy rule).\nCoagulation\nThe purpose of coagulation is to alter the colloids so that they can adhere to each other. During coagulation a positive ion is added to water to reduce the surface charge to the point where the colloids are not repelled from each other. A coagulant is the substance \n *Some colloids are stabilized by their affinity for water, but these types of colloids are of less importance.    dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 272  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 272  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER TREATMENT   273\nFIGURE 6-6\n Effect of salt on electric potential.

Trivalent cation. As indicated in the last section, the colloids most commonly \nfound in natural waters are negatively charged, hence a cation is required to \nneutralize the charge. A trivalent cation is the most efficient cation.\n 2. Nontoxic. This requirement is obvious for the production of a safe water.\n 3. Insoluble in the neutral pH range. The coagulant that is added must precipitate \nout of solution so that high concentrations of the ion are not left in the water. Such precipitation greatly assists the colloid removal process.\nThe two most commonly used coagulants are aluminum (Al\n31) and ferric iron (Fe31). \nBoth meet the above three requirements, and their reactions are outlined here.\nAluminum.  Aluminum can be purchased as either dry or liquid alum [Al 2(SO 4)3 \n? 14H 2O]. Commercial alum has an average molecular weight of 594, which is \nactually an average of 14.3 waters of hydration. Liquid alum is sold as approxi-\nmately 48.8 percent alum (8.3% Al 2O3) and 51.2 percent water. If it is sold as a more \nconcentrated solution, there can be problems with crystallization of the alum during \nshipment and storage. A 48.8 percent alum solution has a crystallization point of 215.68 C. A 50.7 percent alum solution will crystallize at 118.38 C. Dry alum costs \nabout 50 percent more than an equivalent amount "}

The above reaction shifts the carbonate equilibrium and decreases the pH. However, as long as sufficient alkalinity is present and CO\n2(g) is allowed to \nevolve, the pH is not drastically reduced and is generally not an operational problem. When sufficient alkalinity is not present to neutralize the sulfuric acid production, the pH may be greatly reduced:\n A\nl2(SO 4)3?14H 2OL2Al(OH) 3?3H2O(s) 13H2SO 412H2O (6-2)\nIf the second reaction occurs, lime or sodium carbonate may be added to neutralize the acid.\n Two important factors in coagulant addition are pH and dose. The optimum dose and pH must be determined from laboratory tests. The optimal pH range for alum is\u00a0approximately 5.5 to 6.5 with adequate coagulation possible between pH 5 to pH 8 under some conditions. An important aspect of coagulation is that the aluminum ion does not really  exist as Al\n31 and the final product is more complex than Al(OH) 3.

The addition of activated silica is especially useful for treating highly colored, low-turbidity waters because it adds weight to the floc. However, acti-vation of silica does require proper equipment and close operational control, and many plants are hesitant to use it. Clays can act much like activated silica in that they have a slight negative charge and can add weight to the flocs. Clays are also most useful for colored, low-turbidity waters, but are rarely used. Polymers can have a negative charge (anionic), positive charge (cationic), positive and negative charge ( polyamphotyp"}

The active sites adhere to flocs, joining them together and producing a larger, tougher floc that settles better. This process is called interparticle bridging. The type of polymer, dose, and point of addition must be determined for each water, and requirements may change within a plant on a seasonal, or even daily, basis.\n6-3 SOFTENING\nHardness.  The term hardness is used to characterize a water that does not lather well, causes a scum in the bath tub, and leaves hard, white, crusty deposits (scale) on coffee pots, tea kettles, and hot water heaters. The failure to lather well and the forma-tion of scum on bath tubs is the result of the reactions of calcium and magnesium with the soap. For example:\n Ca\n211(Soap)2LCa(Soap) 2(s) (6-5)\nAs a result of this complexation reaction, soap cannot interact with the dirt on clothing, \nand the calcium-soap complex itself forms undesirable precipitates. Hardness is defined as the sum of all polyvalent cations (in consistent units). The \ncommon units of expression are mg/L as CaCO\n3 or meq/L. Qualitative terms used to \n describe hardness are listed in Table 6-8. Because many people object to water containing hardness greater than 150 mg/L as CaCO\n3 suppliers of public water have  considered it a \nbenefit to soften the water, that is, to remove some of the hardness.

As rainwater enters the topsoil, the respiration of microorganisms in-creases the CO\n2 content of the water. As shown in Equation 5-35, the CO 2 reacts with \nthe water to form H 2CO 3. Limestone, which is made up of solid CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 \nreacts with the carbonic acid to form calcium bicarbonate [Ca(HCO 3)2] and magne-\nsium bicarbonate [Mg(HCO 3)2]. While CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 are both insoluble in \n water, the bicarbonates are quite soluble. Gypsum (CaSO 4) and MgSO 4 may also go \ninto solution to contribute to the hardness. Because calcium and magnesium predominate, it is often convenient in perform-ing softening calculations to define the total hardness (TH) of a water as the sum of these elements\n TH 5Ca\n211Mg"}
{"text": "21 (6-6)\nwhere the concentrations of each element are in consistent units (mg/L as CaCO 3 or \nmeq/L). Total hardness is often broken down into two components: (1) that associated \nwith the HCO2\n3 anion (called carbonate hardness  and abbreviated CH), and (2) that \nassociated with other anions (called noncarbonate hardness  and abbreviated NCH).* \n Total hardness, then, may also be defined as\n TH 5CH1NCH (6-7)\n Carbonate hardness is defined as the amount of hardness equal to the total hard-\nness or the total alkalinity, whichever is less. Carbonate hardness is often called  temporary hardness because heating the water removes it. When the pH is less than 8.3, HCO\n2\n3 is the dominant form of alkalinity, and total alkalinity is nominally taken to \nbe equal to the concentration of HCO23.Rain\nSubsoilTopsoil Bacterial Action /H6023 CO2 \nLimestone\nCaCO3(s) /H11001 H2CO3 /H6023 Ca(HCO3)2 CO2 /H11001 H2O /H6023 H2CO3 \nMgCO3(s) /H11001 H2CO3 /H6023 Mg(HCO2)2 FIGURE 6-10\nNatural process by which \n water is made hard.\n*Note that this does not imply that the compounds exist as compounds in solution.

Both methods are discussed in the following sections.\nLime-Soda Softening\nIn lime-soda softening it is possible to calculate the chemical doses necessary to  remove hardness. Hardness precipitation is based on the following two solubility reactions:\n Ca\n211CO22\n3LCaCO 3(s)  (6-8)\nand Mg\n2112OH2LMg(OH) 2(s)  (6-9)\nThe objective is to precipitate the calcium as CaCO 3 and the magnesium as \nMg(OH) 2.

The chemical processes used to soften water are a direct ap-\nplication of the law of mass action. We increase the concentration of CO22\n3 and/or \nOH2 by the addition of chemicals, and drive the reactions given in Equations 6-8 and \n6-9 to the right. Insofar as possible, we convert the naturally occurring bicarbonate alkalinity (HCO\n2\n3) to carbonate (CO22\n3) by the addition of hydroxyl ions (OH2). \n Hydroxyl ions cause the carbonate buffer system (Equation 5-35) to shift to the right \nand, thus, provide the carbonate for the precipitation reaction (Equation 6-8). The common source of hydroxyl ions is calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)\n2]. Many  water \ntreatment plants find it more economical to buy quicklime (CaO), commonly called lime, than hydrated lime [Ca(OH)\n2]. The quicklime is converted to hydrated lime at the \nwater treatment plant by mixing CaO and water to produce a slurry of Ca(OH) 2, which is \nfed to the water for softening. The conversion process is called slaking:\n CaO 1H2OLCa(OH) 21heat  (6-10)\nThe reaction is exothermic. It yields almost 1 MJ per gram mole"}

Because the chemical is purchased as lime, it is common to speak of chemical additions as addition of \u201clime,\u201d when in fact we mean calcium hydroxide. When carbonate ions must be supplied, the most com-mon chemical chosen is sodium carbonate (Na\n2CO 3). Sodium carbonate is commonly \nreferred to as soda ash or soda.\nSoftening Reactions.   The softening reactions are regulated by controlling the pH. \nFirst, any free acids are neutralized. Then pH is raised to precipitate the CaCO 3; if \n necessary, the pH is raised further to remove Mg(OH) 2.

Because of economic constraints, many utilities will \noperate at total hardness goals of up to 140 to 150 mg/L. In order to achieve reasonable removal of hardness in a reasonable time period, an excess of Ca(OH)\n2 beyond the stoichiometric amount usually is provided. Based on \nour empirical experience, a minimum excess of 20 mg/L of Ca(OH) 2 expressed as \nCaCO 3 must be provided.\n Magnesium in excess of about 40 mg/L as CaCO 3 forms scales on heat exchange \nelements in hot water heaters. Because of the expense of removing magnesium, we normally remove only that magnesium which is in excess of 40 mg/L as CaCO\n3. For \nmagnesium removals less than 20 mg/L as CaCO 3, the basic excess of lime mentioned \nabove is sufficient to ensure good results. For magnesium removals between 20 and 40 mg/L as CaCO\n3, we must add an excess of lime equal to the magnesium to be \nremoved. For magnesium removals greater than 40 mg/L as CaCO 3, the excess lime \nwe need to add is 40 mg/L as CaCO 3.

C O 2 is of importance in two instances in softening. \nIn the first instance, it consumes lime that otherwise could be used to remove Ca and Mg. When the concentration of CO\n2 exceeds 10 mg/L as CO 2 (22.7 mg/L as CaCO 3 or \n0.45 meq/L), the economics of removal of CO 2 by aeration (stripping) are favored over \nremoval by lime neutralization. In the second instance, CO 2 is used to neutralize the \nhigh pH of the effluent from the softening process. These reactions are an application of the concepts of the carbonate buffer system discussed in Chapter 5. The concentration of CO\n2 may be estimated by using the equilibrium expres-\nsions for the dissociation of water and carbonic acid with the definition of alkalinity (Equation 5-36). The pH and alkalinity of the water must be"}

What is the estimated CO\n2 concentration of a water with a pH of 7.65 \nand a total alkalinity of 310 mg/L as CaCO 3?\nSolution.  When the raw water pH is less than 8.5, we can assume that the alkalinity \nis predominately HCO 32. Thus, we can ignore the dissociation of bicarbonate to form \ncarbonate. With this assumption, the procedure to solve the problem is\n a. Calculate the [H\n1] from the pH.\n b.  Calculate the [HCO 32 ] from the alkalinity.\n c. Solve the first equilibrium expression of the carbonic acid dissociation for \n[H2CO 3].\n d.

In Example 6-5, the NCH R was found to be a neg-\native number. This implies that the water will be softened to a hardness less than the desired value. One way to overcome this difficulty is to treat a portion of the water to the practical limits and then blend the treated water with the raw water to achieve the  desired hardness. Unlike the flowchart method used in Examples 6-4 through 6-6, calculations of chemical additions to soften to the practical limits of softening (that is\u00a00.60 meq/L or 30 mg/L as CaCO\n3 of Ca and 0.20 meq/L or 10 mg/L as CaCO 3 of \nMg(OH) 2), do not take into account the desired final hardness.

By the above reaction, calcium \n(or magnesium) has been removed from the water and replaced by an equivalent amount of sodium, that is, two sodium ions for each cation. The alkalinity remains unchanged. The exchange results in essentially 100 percent removal of the hardness from the water until the exchange capacity of the ion-exchange material is reached, as shown in Figure 6-19. When the ion-exchange material becomes saturated, no hard-ness will be removed. At this point breakthrough is said to have occurred because the \nhardness passes through the bed. At this point the column is taken out of service, and the ion-exchange material is regenerated. That is, the hardness is removed from the material by passing water containing a large amount of Na\n1 through the column. The \nmass action of having so much Na1 in the water causes the hardness of the ion- \nexchange material to enter the water and exchange with the sodium:\n CaR 212NaClL2NaR 1CaCl 2 (6-20)\nThe ion-exchange material can now be used to remove more hardness. The CaCl 2 is a \nwaste stream that must be disposed of.\n There are some large water treatment plants that utilize ion-exchange softening, but the most common application is for residential water softeners. The ion-exchange material can either be naturally occurring clays, called zeolites, or synthetically made \nresins. There are several manufacturers o"}
{"text": "f synthetic resins. The resins or zeolites are\u00a0characterized by the amount of hardness that they will remove per volume of resin material and by the amount of salt required to regenerate the resin. The synthetically produced resins have a much higher exchange capacity and require less salt for regen-eration. However, they also cost much more. People who work in the water softening industry often work in units of grains of hardness per gallon of water (gr/gal). It is use-ful to remember that 1 gr/gal equals 17.1 mg/L. Since the resin removes virtually 100 percent of the hardness, it is necessary to bypass a portion of the water and then blend in order to obtain the desired final hardness.\n %Bypass 5(100) Hardness\ndesired\nHardness initial (6-21)Effluent\nHardness\nTimeSaturation\nof Ion-\nExchange\nMaterialInfluent\nHardnessHardness, mg/L as CaCO3\n FIGURE 6-19\nHardness removal in ion-exchange column.dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 298  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 298  13/10/11  5:49 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER TREATMENT   299\nExample 6-10.

In this section we will begin to look at the physical methods necessary to accomplish the chemical processes of co-agulation and softening. Mixing, or rapid mixing as it is called, is the process whereby the chemicals are \nquickly and uniformly dispersed in the water. Ideally, the chemicals would be instan-taneously dispersed throughout the water. During coagulation and softening, the chemical reactions that take place in rapid mixing form precipitates. Either aluminum hydroxide or iron hydroxide form during coagulation, while calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide f"}
{"text": "orm during softening. The precipitates formed in these pro-cesses must be brought into contact with one another so that they can agglomerate and form larger particles, called flocs. This contacting process is called flocculation and is accomplished by slow, gentle mixing. In the treatment of water and wastewater, the degree of mixing is measured by the velocity gradient, G . The velocity gradient is best thought of as the amount of \nshear taking place; that is, the higher the G  value, the more violent the mixing. The \nvelocity gradient is a function of the power input into a unit volume of water.

Coagulation occurs \npredominately by two mechanisms: adsorption of the soluble hydrolysis species on the colloid and destabilization or sweep coagulation where the colloid is trapped in the hydroxide precipitate. The reactions in adsorption-destabilization are extremely fast and occur within 1 second. Sweep coagulation is slower and occurs in the range of 1 to 7 seconds (Amirtharajah, 1978). Jar test data may be"}
{"text": " used to identify whether adsorption-destabilization or sweep coagulation is predominant. If charge reversal is apparent from the dose-turbidity curve (see, for example, Figure 6-9), then adsorption- destabilization is the predominant mechanism. If the dose-turbidity curve does not show charge reversal (that is, the curve is relatively flat at higher doses), then the predominant mechanism is sweep coagulation. G values in the \nrange of 3,000 to 5,000 s\n21 and detention times on the order of 0.5 s are recom-\nmended for adsorption-desorption  reactions. These values are most commonly achieved in an in-line blender. For sweep coagulation, detention times of 1 to 10 s and G values in the range of 600 to 1,000 s\n21 are recommended (Amirtharajah, \n1978). An exception to these time requirements is for color or natural organic matter removal.

The tanks should be horizontally baffled into at least two and preferably three compartments in order to provide sufficient residence time. They are also baffled vertically to minimize vortexing.

{"text": "oo much mixing will shear the floc particles so that the floc is small and finely dispersed. Therefore, the velocity gradient must be controlled within a relatively nar-row range. Flexibility should also be built into the flocculator so that the plant operator can vary the G value by a factor of two to three. The heavier the floc and the higher the suspended solids concentration, the more mixing is required to keep the floc in suspen-sion. This is reflected in Table 6-10. Softening floc is heavier than coagulation floc and therefore requires a higher G value. An increase in the floc concentration (as measured by the suspended solids concentration) also increases the required G. With water tem-peratures of approximately 208C, modern plants provide about 20 minutes of floccula-tion time (t ) at plant capacity. With lower temperatures, the detention time is increased. \nAt 158 C the detention time is increased by 7 percent, at 10 8C it is increased 15 percent, \nand at 58C it is increased 25 percent.Side view\nSide view\nBottom view Bottom view\nRadial Flow Axial FlowBaffles Baffles\nFIGURE 6-24\nBasic flow patterns created by impellers.

Following the baffle system, the flow takes on a flow pattern determined by the inlet structure. At some point the flow pattern is evenly distributed, and the water velocity slowed to the design velocity of the sedimentation zone. At that point the inlet zone "}
{"text": "ends and the settling zone begins. With a well-designed inlet baffle system, the inlet zone extends approximately 1.5 m down the length of the tank. Proper inlet zone design may well be the most important aspect of removal efficiency. With improper design, the inlet velocities may never subside to the settling-zone design velocity. Typical design numbers are usually conservative enough that an inlet zone length does not have to be added to the length calculated for the settling zone. In an accurate design, the inlet and settling zones are each designed separately and their lengths added together. The configuration and depth of the sludge storage zone depends upon the method of cleaning, the frequency of cleaning, and the quantity of sludge estimated to be produced. All these variables can be evaluated and a sludge storage zone designed. In lieu of these design details, some general guidelines can be presented. With a well-flocculated solid and good inlet design, over 75 percent of the solids may settle in the first fifth of the tank. For coagulant floc, Hudson recommends a sludge storage depth of about 0.3 m near the outlet and 2 m or more near the inlet (Hudson, 1981). If the tank is long enough, storage depth can be provided by bottom slope; if not, a sludge hopper is necessary at the inlet end or the overall tank is made deeper. Mechanically-cleaned basins may be equipped with a bottom scraper, such as shown in Figure 6-29 for a circular tank. The sludge is continuously sc"}

A sludge hopper is designed with sides sloping with a vertical to horizontal ratio of 1.2:1 to 2:1. For horizontal tanks a bottom col-lection device is used such as shown in Figure 6-30. These devices travel the length of the basin and remove sludge via pump or siphon action. The outlet zone is designed so as to remove the settled water from the basin with-out carrying away any of the floc particles.

The easiest way to understand these \ntwo concepts is to view an upward-flow sedimentation tank as shown in Figure 6-32. In this design, the particles fall downward and the water rises vertically. The rate at which the particle is settling downward is the particle-settling velocity, and the veloc-ity of the liquid rising is the overflow rate. Obviously, if a particle is to be removed from the bottom of the clarifier and not go out in the settled water, then the particle- settling velocity must be greater than the liquid-rise velocity or overflow rate (y\ns . yo). \nIf ys is greater than y o, one would expect 100 percent particle removal, and if y s is less \nthan yo, one would expect 0 percent removal.

Sedimentation zones vary from a depth of a few centimeters to a depth of 6 m or greater.* We can show that particle removal in a horizontal sedimentation tank is likewise dependent only upon the overflow rate. An ideal horizontal sedimentation tank is based upon three assumptions (Hazen, 1904, and Camp, 1946):\n 1. Particles and velocity vectors are evenly distributed across the tank cross \n section.

Generally speaking, the only application of Type I settling is during presedimentation for sand removal prior to coagulation in a potable water plant, in settling of sand particles during cleaning of rapid sand filters, and in grit chambers.\nType II Sedimentation.  Type II sedimentation is characterized by particles that \nflocculate during sedimentation. Because they flocculate, their size is constantly changing; therefore, the settling velocity is changing. Generally the settling velocity is increasing. These types of particles occur in alum or iron coagulation, in primary sedi-mentation, and in settling tanks in trickling filtration.\nType III or Zone Sedimentation.   In zone sedimentation the particles are at a high \nconcentration (greater than 1,000 mg/L) such that the particles tend to settle as a mass, and \na distinct clear zone and sludge zone are present. Zone settling occurs in lime-softening sedimentation, activated-sludge sedimentation, and sludge thickeners.\nDetermination of Y o\nThere are different ways to determine effective particle-settling velocities and conse-quently to de"}

The settled water \nturbidity is generally in the range from 1 to 10 TU with a typical value being 2 TU. In order to reduce this turbidity to less than 0.3 TU, a filtration process is  normally used. Water filtration is a process for separating suspended or colloidal impurities from  water by passage through a porous medium, usually a bed of sand or other medium. Water fills the pores (open spaces) between the sand particles, and the impurities are left behind, either clogged in the open spaces or attached to the sand itself. There are several methods of classifying filters. One way is to classify them  according to the type of medium used, such as sand, coal (called anthracite), dual media (coal plus sand), or mixed media (coal, sand, and garnet). Another common way to clas-sify the filters is by allowable loading rate. Loading rate is the flow rate of water  applied \nper unit area of the filter. It is the velocity of the water approaching the face of the filter:\n y\na5Q\nAs  (6-47)\nwhere y a 5 face velocity, m/d\n  5 loading rate, m3/d ? m2\n  Q 5 flow rate onto filter surface, m3/d\n  As 5 surface area of filte"}
{"text": "r, m2\n Based on loading rate, the filters are described as being slow sand filters, rapid \nsand filters, or high-rate sand filters. Slow sand filters were first introduced in the 1800s. The water is applied to the sand at a loading rate of 2.9 to 7.6 m\n3/d ? m2 (0.05 to 0.13 gpm/ft2). As the  suspended \nor colloidal material is applied to the sand, the particles begin to collect in the top 75 mm and to clog the pore spaces. As the pores become clogged, water will no longer pass through the sand. At this point the top layer of sand is scraped off, cleaned, and  replaced. Slow sand filters require large areas of land and are operator intensive. In the early 1900s there was a need to install filtration systems in large numbers in order to prevent epidemics. Rapid sand filters were developed to meet this need. These fil-ters have graded (layered) sand within the bed. The sand grain size  distribution is selected to optimize the passage of water while minimizing the  passage of particulate matter. Rapid sand filters are cleaned in place by forcing water backwards through the sand. This operation is called backwashing. The washwater flow rate is such that the dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 324  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 324  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER TREATMENT   325\nsand is expanded and the filtered particles"}
{"text": " are removed from the bed. After backwash-\ning, the sand settles back into place. The largest particles settle first, resulting in a fine sand layer on top and a coarse sand layer on the bottom. Rapid sand filters are the most common type of filter used in water treatment today. Traditionally, rapid sand filters have been designed to operate at a loading rate of 120 m\n3/d ? m2 (2 gpm/ft2). Experiments conducted at the Chicago water treatment \nplant have demonstrated that satisfactory water quality can be obtained with rates as high as 235 m\n3/d ? m2 (4 gpm/ft2) (AWWA, 1971). Filters now operate successfully at \neven higher loading rates through the use of proper media selection and improved pre-treatment. Normally, a minimum of two filters are constructed to ensure redundancy. For larger plants (. 0.5 m\n3/s), a minimum of four filters is suggested (Montgomery, \n1985). The surface area  of the filter tank (often called a filter box) is generally re-stricted in size to about 100 m\n2, except for very large plants.\n In the wartime era of the early 1940s, dual-media filters were developed. They are designed to utilize more of the filter depth for particle removal. In a rapid sand filter, the finest sand is on the top; hence, the smallest pore spaces are also on the top. There-fore, most of the particles will clog in the top layer of the filter. In order to use more of the filter depth for particle removal, it is necessary to have the large particles on top of\u00a0the small particles. "}
{"text": "This was accomplished by placing a layer of coarse coal on top of a layer of fine sand. Coal has a lower specific gravity than sand, so, after backwash, it settles slower than the sand and ends up on top. Dual-media filters are operated up to loading rates of 350 m\n3/d ? m2 (6 gpm/ft2) or higher.\n In the mid 1980s, deep-bed monomedia filters came into use. The filters are designed to achieve higher loading rates while at the same time producing lower finished water turbidities. The filters typically consist of 1.0 mm to 1.5 mm  diameter anthracite about 1.5 m to 2.5 m deep. They operate at loading rates up to 700 m\n3/d ? m2 (12 gpm/f2).\nExample 6-17.  As part of their proposed new treatment plant, Urbana is going to install rapid sand filters after their sedimentation tanks. The design loading rate to the filter is 200 m\n3/d ? m2. How much filter surface area should be provided for their de-\nsign flow rate of 0.5 m3/s? How large should the filter be if four filters are used?\nSolution.

The sand depth varies be-\ntween 0.5 and 0.75 m. If a dual media filter is used, the sand is about 0.3 m thick and the coal about 0.45 m thick. Approximately 0.7 m to 1 m above the top of the sand are the washwater troughs. The washwater troughs collect the backwash water used to clean the filter. The troughs are placed high enough above the sand layer so that sand will not be carried out with the backwash water. Generally a total depth of 1.8 m to 3\u00a0m is allowed above the sand layer for water to build up above the filter. This depth of water provides sufficient pressure to force the water through the sand during filtration. Figure 6-39 shows a slightly simplified version of a rapid sand filter. Water from the settling basins enters the filter and seeps through the sand and gravel bed, through a false floor, and out into a clear well that acts as a storage tank for finished water. During filtration, valves A and C are open. During filtration the filter bed will become more and more clogged. As the filter clogs, the water level will rise above the sand as it becomes harder to force water through the bed. Eventually, the water level will rise to the point t"}

After a few minutes the washwater is shut off and filtration resumed.\nGrain Size Characteristics\nThe size distribution or variation of a sample of granular material is determined by sieving the sample through a series of standard sieves (screens). One such standard series is the U.S. Standard Sieve Series. The U.S. Standard Sieve Series (Table 6-13) is based on a sieve opening of 1 mm. Sieves in the \u201cfine series\u201d stand successively in the ratio of (2)\n1/4 to one another, the largest opening in this series being 5.66 mm \nand the smallest 0.037 mm. All material that passes through the smallest sieve opening in the series is caught in a pan that acts as the terminus of the series (Fair and Geyer, 1954). The grain size analysis begins by placing the sieve screens in ascending order with the largest opening on top and the smallest opening on the bottom. A sand sample is placed on the top sieve and the stack is shaken for a prescribed amount of time. At the end of the shaking period, the mass of material retained on each sieve is determined. The cumulative mass is recorded and converted into percentages by mass equal to or less than the size of separation of the overlying sieve. Then the cumulative frequency distribution is plotted.

Minimum fluidization velocity is the velocity necessary to overcome the weight of the media and raise it into the water. By achieving fluidization velocity the media is cleaned of accumulated turbidity and allowed to re-stratify when the backwash is turned off. If the backwash velocity is not high enough to fluidize the large particles then they will tend to sink to the bot-tom of the filter. The calculation of the minimum fluidization velocity is based on the fixed bed head loss being equal to the constant head loss of the fluidized bed at the point of incipient fluidization. An equation called the Ergun equation can be equated to the constant-head loss equation and solved for the minimum fluidization velocity, that is, y\nmf. The accuracy of the result depends on using realistic values for \nsphericity c and fixed bed porosity P. By using an approximate relation between \nsphericity and porosity, Wen and "}

They must destroy the kinds and numbers of pathogens that may be intro-\nduced into water within a practicable period of time over an expected range in \nwater temperature.\n 2. They must meet possible fluctuations in composition, concentration, and con-\ndition of the waters or wastewaters to be treated.\n 3. They must be neither toxic to humans and domestic animals nor unpalatable \nor otherwise objectionable in required concentrations.\n 4.

Under real conditions the rate of kill may depart signifi-\ncantly from Chick\u2019s law. Increased rates of kill may occur because of a time lag in the disinfectant reaching vital centers in the cell. Decreased rates of kill may occur because of declining concentrations of disinfectant in solution or poor distribution of organisms and disinfectant.\nChlorine Reactions in Water\nChlorine is the most common disinfecting chemical used. The term chlorination"}
{"text": " is \noften used synonymously with disinfection. Chlorine may be used as the element (Cl\n2), as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), or as calcium hypochlorite [Ca(OCl) 2].\n When chlorine is added to water, a mixture of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hy-drochloric acid (HCl) is formed:\n Cl\n2(g)1H2OLHOCl 1H11Cl2 (6-58)\nThis reaction is pH dependent and essentially complete within a very few millisec-\nonds. In dilute solution and at pH levels above 1.0, the equilibrium is displaced to the right and very little Cl\n2 exists in solution. Hypochlorous acid is a weak acid and dis-\nsociates poorly at levels of pH below about 6. Between pH 6.0 and 8.5 there occurs a very sharp change from undissociated HOCl to almost complete dissociation:\n  H\nOClLH11OCl2 (6-59)\n pK57.537 at 25\u00b0C\nThus, chlorine exists predominantly as HOCl at pH levels between 4.0 and 6.0. Below \npH 1.0, depending on the chloride concentration, the HOCl reverts back to Cl 2 as \nshown in Equation 6-58. At 20 8C, above about pH 7.5, and at 0 8C, above about pH\u00a07.8, \nhypochlorite ions (OCl2) predominate. Hypochlorite ions exist almost exclusively at \nlevels of pH around 9 and above. Chlorine existing in the form of HOCl and/or OCl2 \nis defined as free available chlorine.

Thus, the same active chlorine species and\u00a0equilibrium are established in water regardless of whether elemental chlorine or hypochlorites are used. The significant difference is in the resultant pH and its influ-ence on the relative amounts of HOCl and OCl\n2 existing at equilibrium. Elemental \nchlorine tends to decrease pH; each mg/L of chlorine added reduces the alkalinity by up to 1.4 mg/L as CaCO\n3. Hypochlorites, on the other hand, always contain excess \nalkali to enhance their stability and tend to raise the pH somewhat. We seek to main-tain the design pH within a range of 6.5 to 7.5 to optimize disinfecting action.\nChlorine-Disinfecting Action\nChlorine disinfection involves a very complex series of events and is influenced by the kind and extent of reactions with chlorine-reactive materials (including nitrogen), tem-perature, pH, the viability of test organisms, and numerous other factors. Such factors greatly complicate attempts to determine the precise mode of action of chlorine on bacteria and other microorganisms. Over the years, several theories have been  advanced. One early theory held that chlorine reacts directly with water to produce nascent oxygen; another held that the action of chlorine is due to compl"}
{"text": "ete oxidative destruction of organisms. These theories were nullified because small concentrations of hypochlorous acid were observed to destroy bacteria whereas other oxidants (such as hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate) failed to do likewise. A later theory suggested that chlorine reacts with protein and amino acids of cells to alter and ulti-mately destroy cell protoplasm. Currently it is considered that the bactericidal action of chlorine is physiochemical, but among yet-unanswered questions are those pertaining to phenomena such as variations in resistance of bacteria, spores, cysts, and viruses, and the appearance of mutants.

{"text": "5_pagefiles340  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nChlorine /Ammonia Reactions\nThe reactions of chlorine with ammonia are of great significance in water chlorination \nprocesses. When chlorine is added to water that contains natural or added ammonia (ammonium ion exists in equilibrium with ammonia and hydrogen ions), the ammonia reacts with HOCl to form various chloramines which, like HOCl, retain the oxidizing power of the chlorine. The reactions between chlorine and ammonia may be repre-sented as follows (AWWA, 1971):\n NH\n31HOClLNH 2Cl1H2O (6-65)\nMonoc hloram ine\n NH 2Cl1HOClLNHCl 21H2O (6-66)\nDichloram ine\nNHCl 21HOClLNCl 31H2O\n Tr ichloram ine or n itrogen tr ichloride (6-67)\n The distribution of the reaction products is governed by the rates of formation of \nmonochloramine and dichloramine, which are dependent upon pH, temperature, time, and initial Cl\n2:NH 3 ratio. In general, high Cl 2:NH 3 ratios, low temperatures, and low \npH levels favor dichloramine formation. Chlorine also reacts with organic nitrogenous materials, such as proteins and amino acids, to form organic chloramine complexes. Chlorine that exists in water in chemical combination with ammonia or organic nitrogen compounds is defined as combined available chlorine. The oxidizing capacity of free chlorine solutions varies with pH because of varia-tions in the resultant HOCl:OCl\n2 ratios. This applies also in the case of chloramine \n solutions as a result of varying NHCl 2:NH 2Cl ratios, and where mono"}
{"text": "chloramine pre-\ndominates at high pH levels. The disinfecting ability of the chloramines is much lower than that of free available chlorine, indicating that the ammonia chloramines also are less reactive than free available chlorine.\nPractices of Water Chlorination\nEvolution.  Early water chlorination practices (variously termed \u201cplain chlorination,\u201d \u201csimple chlorination,\u201d and \u201cmarginal chlorination\u201d) were applied for the purpose of disinfection. Chlorine-ammonia treatment was soon thereafter introduced to limit the\u00a0development of objectionable tastes and odors often associated with marginal chlo-rine disinfection. Subsequently, \u201csuper-chlorination\u201d was developed for the additional purpose of destroying objectionable taste- and odor-producing substances often asso-ciated with chlorine-containing organic materials. The introduction of \u201cbreakpoint chlorination\u201d and the recognition that chlorine residuals can exist in two distinct forms established contemporary water chlorination as one of two types: combined residual chlorination or free residual chlorination.\nCombined Residual Chlorination.  Combined residual chlorination practice involves \nthe application of chlorine to water in order to produce, with natural or added ammonia, a dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 340  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 340  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav011"}

Combined available chlorine forms have lower oxidation potentials than free available chlorine forms and, therefore, are less effective as oxidants. Moreover, they are also less effective disinfectants. In fact, about 25 times as much combined available residual chlorine as free available residual chlorine is necessary to obtain equivalent bacterial kills (S. typhosa) under the same conditions of pH, temperature, and contact time. And about 100 times longer contact is required to obtain equivalent bacterial kills under the same conditions and for equal amounts of combined and free available chlorine residuals. When a combined available chlorine residual is desired, the characteristics of the water will determine how it can be accomplished:\n 1. If the water contains sufficient ammonia to produce with added chlorine a \ncombined available chlorine residual of the desired magnitude, the application \nof chlorine alone suffices.\n 2. If the water contains too little or no ammonia, the addition of both chlorine and \nammonia is required.\n 3. If the water has an existing free available chlorine residual, the addition of \nammonia will convert the residual to combined available residual chlorine. A combined available chlorine residual should contain little or no free available chlorine.\n The practice of combined resi"}
{"text": "dual chlorination is especially applicable after  filtration (post treatment) for controlling certain algae and bacterial growths and for providing and maintaining a stable residual throughout the system to the point of consumer use. Although combined chlorine residual is not as good a disinfectant as free chlorine, it has an advantage over free chlorine residual in that it is reduced more slowly and, therefore, persists for a longer time in the distribution system. Thus, it is useful as an indicator of major contamination. Water plant personnel routinely monitor the chlorine level in the distribution system. The presence of available chlorine (either combined or free) indicates that no major contamination has occurred. If major contamination does take place, the combined chlorine residual will be depleted, albeit at a slow rate. This depletion serves as a warning that contamination may have taken place. A chloramine residual also has the advantage of minimizing the formation of disin-fection by-products (DBPs), as chloramines are not a strong enough oxidant to react with the organic matter in the water and form chlorinated hydrocarbons. An increasingly com-mon disinfection strategy is to add chlorine in order to achieve Giardia and virus CT and \nthen add ammonia to form chloramines and stop or reduce the DBP  formation.

Chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) is formed \non-site by combining chlorine and sodium chlorite. Chlorine dioxide is often used as a  primary disinfectant, inactivating the bacteria and cysts, followed by the use of chloramine as a distribution system disinfectant. Chlorine dioxide does not maintain a residual long enough to be useful as a distribution-system disinfectant. The advan-tage of chlorine dioxide over chlorine is that chlorine dioxide does not react with precursors to form DBPs. When chlorine dioxide reacts in water, it forms two by-products, chlorite and, to some extent, chlorate. These compounds may be associated with a human health risk, and therefore many state regulatory agencies limit the dose of chlorine dioxide to 1.0\u00a0mg/L. In many cases this may not be a sufficient dose to provide good disinfection. Chlorine dioxide use has also been associated with tastes and odors in some communi-ties. The health concerns, taste and odors, and relatively high cost have tended to limit the use of chlorine dioxide. However, many utilities have successfully used chlorine dioxide as a primary disinfectant.\nOzonation\nOzone is a pungent-smelling, unstable gas.

U.S. EPA has established UV dose requirements. Table 6-18 shows the U.S. EPA requirements.

UV electromagnetic energy is typically generated by the flow of electrons from an electrical source through ionized mercury vapor in a lamp. Several manufactures have developed systems to align UV lamps in vessels or channels to provide UV light in the\u00a0germicidal range for inactivation of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. The UV lamps are similar to household fluorescent lamps, except that fluorescent lamps are coated with phosphorus, which converts the UV light to visible light. Ballasts (i.e., transformers) that control the power of the UV lamps are either elec-tronic or electromagnetic.

Hy-\ndroxyl radicals are highly reactive nonselective oxidants able to decompose many organic \ncompounds. Most noteworthy of the AOP processes is ozone plus hydrogen peroxide.\n6-8 ADSORPTION\nAdsorption is a mass transfer process wherein a substance is transferred from the liquid phase to the surface of a solid where it is bound by chemical or physical forces. Generally, in water treatment, the adsorbent (solid) is activated carbon, either granular (GAC) or powdered (PAC). PAC is fed to the raw water in a slurry and is generally used to remove taste- and odor-causing substance"}
{"text": "s or to provide some  removal of  synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs). GAC is added to the existing filter system by  replacing the anthracite with GAC, or an additional contactor is built and is placed in the flow scheme after primary filtration. The design of the GAC contactor is very similar to a filter box, although deeper. At present, the applications of adsorption in water treatment in the United States are predominately for taste and odor removal. However, adsorption is increasingly  being considered for removal of SOCs, VOCs, and naturally occurring organic matter, such as THM precursors and DBPs. Biologically derived earthy-musty odors in water supplies are a widespread prob-lem. Their occurrence interval and concentration vary greatly from season to season and is often unpredictable. As mentioned, one of the most popular methods for removing these compounds is the addition of PAC to the raw water. The dose is generally less than 10 mg/L. The advantage of PAC is that the capital equipment is relatively inexpensive and it can be used on an as-needed basis. The disadvantage is that the  adsorption is often incomplete. Sometimes even doses of 50 mg/L are not sufficient. As an alternative for taste and odor control, many plants have replaced the anthracite in the filters with GAC. The GAC will last from one to three years and then must be replaced. It is very effective in removing many taste and odor compounds. Concern about SOCs in drinking water has motivated interest i"}
{"text": "n adsorption as a treat-ment process for removal of toxic and potentially carcinogenic compounds present in minute, but significant, quantities. Few other processes can remove SOCs to the required low levels. Generally, GAC is used for SOC removal either as a filter media replacement or as a separate contactor. The data for how long the GAC will last for any given SOC are somewhat limited and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If the GAC is designed to remove SOCs from a periodic \u201cspill\u201d into the source water, then filter media replacement may be adequate  because the GAC is not being used every day and is acting as a barrier. However, if the GAC is\u00a0to be used continuously for SOC removal, then a separate contactor may be  warranted. GAC has been proposed to be used to remove naturally occurring organic matter that would, in turn, reduce the formation of DBPs. Testing has shown that GAC will  remove these organics. It must operate in a separate contactor since the depth of a con-ventional filter is inadequate. The GAC will typically last 90 to 120 days until it loses its adsorptive capacity. Because of its short life, the GAC needs to be regenerated by burning in a high-temperature furnace. This can be done on-site or can be done by  returning the GAC to the manufacture.dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 348  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 348  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolum"}

GAC is not considered practical for THM removal.\n6-9 MEMBRANES\nA membrane is a thin layer of material that is capable of separating materials as a function of their physical and chemical properties when a driving force is applied across the membrane. In the case of water treatment, the driving force is supplied by using a high pressure pump and the membrane type is selected based on the constitu-ents to be  removed. In the membrane process, the feed stream is divided into two streams, the concen-trate or reject stream, and the permeate or product stream as shown in Figure 6-43. The membrane is at the heart of every membrane process and can be considered a barrier  between the feed and product water that does not allow certain contaminants to pass, as represented by Figure 6-44. There is a pressure drop across the membrane, called the transmembrane pressure (TMP) that must be overcome by the water feed pump. The performance or efficiency of a given membrane is  determined by its selectivity and the applied flow. The efficiency is called the flux and is defined as the volume flowing through the membrane per unit area and time, m\n3/m2 ? s (gpm/ft2 or gpd/ft2). \nThe selectivity of a membrane toward a mixture is expressed by its retention, R, and is \ngiven by\n R5cp2cf\ncp"}

The anticipation of more stringent water quality regula-tions, a decrease in availability of adequate water resources, and an emphasis on\u00a0water for reuse has made membrane processes more viable as a water treatment process. As  advances are being made in membrane technology, capital and operation and maintenance costs continue to decline, further endorsing the use of membrane treatment techniques.\nFIGURE 6-43\nSchematic representation of a membrane process.PermeateHigh-pressure\npumpFeedMembrane module\nRejec tdav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 349  11/5/11  1:43 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 349  11/5/11  1:43 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles350  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n Membranes can be described by a variety of criteria including: (Jacangelo et al., 1997)\n \u2022 membrane pore size\n \u2022 molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) \u2022 membrane material and geometry \u2022 targeted materials to be removed \u2022 type of water quality to be treated, and/or \u2022 treated water quality\nAlong with these criteria, membrane processes can also be categorized broadly into "}

Water treatment plants and the residuals they produce can be broadly divided into four general categories. First are those treatment plants that coagulate, filter, and  oxidize a surface water for removal of turbidity, color, bacteria, algae, some organic compounds, and often iron and/or manganese. These plants generally use alum or iron salts for coagulation and produce two waste streams. The majority of the waste pro-duced from these plants is sedimentation basin (or clarifier) sludge and spent filter backwash water (SFBW). The second type of treatment plants are those that practice dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 351  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch06_250-387.indd Page 351  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles352  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nsoftening for the removal of calcium and magnesium by the addit"}

Softening plant wastes can also contain trace inorganics such as radium that could affect their proper han-dling. The third type of plants are those that are designed to specifically remove trace inorganics such as nitrate, fluoride, radium, arsenic, and so forth. These plants use processes such as ion exchange, reverse osmosis, or adsorption. They produce liquid residuals or solid residuals such as spent adsorption material. The fourth category of treatment plants are those that produce air-phase residuals during the stripping of  volatile compounds. The major types of  treatment plant residuals produced are shown in Table 6-19. Because 95 percent of the residuals produced are coagulants or soften-ing sludge, they will be stressed in this section. Hydrolyzing metal salts or synthetic organic polymers are added in the water treatment process to coagulate suspended and dissolved contaminants and yield rela-tively clean water suitable for filtration. Most of these coagulants and the impurities they remove settle to the bottom of the settling basin where they become part of the sludge. These sludges are referred to as alum, iron, or polymeric sludge according to which primary coagulant is used. These wastes account for approximately 70 percent of the water plant waste generated.

{"text": "g these lines.\nSludge Production and Characteristics\nIn water treatment plants, sludge is most commonly produced in the following treat-ment processes: presedimentation, sedimentation, and filtration (filter backwash).\nPresedimentation.  When surface waters are withdrawn from watercourses that con-\ntain a large quantity of suspended materials, presedimentation prior to coagulation may be practiced. The purpose of this is to reduce the accumulation of solids in subse-quent units. The settled material generally consists of fine sand, silt, clays, and organic decomposition products.\nSoftening Sedimentation Basin.  The residues from softening by precipitation with \nlime [Ca(OH)\n2] and soda ash (Na 2CO 3) will vary from a nearly pure chemical to a \nhighly variable mixture. The softening process discussed earlier in this chapter  produces a sludge containing primarily CaCO\n3 and Mg(OH) 2.\n Theoretically, each mg/L of calcium hardness removed produces 1 mg/L of CaCO\n3 sludge; each mg/L of magnesium hardness removed produces 0.6 mg/L of \nsludge; and each mg/L of lime added produces 1 mg/L of sludge.

The solids content of lime-softening sludge in the sedimentation basin ranges between 2 and 15 percent. A nominal value of 10 percent solids is often used.\nCoagulation Sedimentation Basin.  Aluminum or iron salts are generally used to \n accomplish coagulation. (The chemistry of the two salts was discussed earlier in this chapter.)

In this range the insoluble aluminum hydroxide complex of \nAl(H 2O)3(OH) 3 probably predominates. This species results in the production of \n0.44 kg of chemical sludge for each kg of alum added. Any suspended solids present in the water will produce an equal amount of sludge. The amount of sludge produced per turbidity unit is not as obvious; however, in many waters a correlation does exist. Carbon, polymers, and clay will produce about 1 kg of sludge per kg of chemical addition."}

To give you an appreciation of these solids concentrations, a coagulant sludge cake with 25 percent solids would have the consistency of soft clay, while a 15 percent sludge would have a consistency much like rubber cement. After removal of the sludge from the clarifier or sedimentation basin, the first treat-ment step is usually thickening.

Thickeners can be designed based on pilot evaluations or using data obtained from similar plants. Lime sludges are typically loaded at 100 to 200 kg/m\n2?d, \n(20 to 40 lb m/ft2?d) and coagulant sludge loading rates are about 15 to 25 kg/m2?d.\n Following thickening of the sludge, dewatering can take place by either mechani-cal or nonmechanical means. In nonmechanical devices, sludge is spread out with the free water draining and the remaining water evaporating. Sometimes the amount of free water available to drain is enhanced by natural freeze-thaw cycles. In mechanical dewatering, some type of device is used to force the water out of the sludge. We begin our discussion with the nonmechanical methods and follow with the mechanical methods.\nLagoons.  A lagoon is essentially a large hole that is dug out for the sludge to flow \ninto. Lagoons can be constructed as either storage lagoons or dewatering lagoons.

They will generally have decant capabilities but no underdrain sys-\ntem. Storage lagoons should be equipped with sealed bottoms to protect the ground-water. Once the storage lagoon is full or decant can no longer meet discharge limitations, it must be abandoned or cleaned. To facilitate drying, the standing water may be removed by pumping, leaving a wet sludge. Coagulant sludges can only be expected to reach a 7 to 10 percent solids concentration in storage lagoons. The re-maining solids must be either cleaned out wet or allowed to evaporate. Depending upon the depth of the wet solids, evaporation can take years. The top layers will often form a crust, preventing evaporation of the bottom layers of sludge. The primary difference between a dewatering lagoon and a storage lagoon is that a dewatering lagoon has a sand and underdrain-bottom, similar to a drying bed. Dewater-ing lagoons can be designed to achieve a dewa"}
{"text": "tered sludge cake. The advantage of a de-watering lagoon over a drying bed is that storage is built into the system to assist in meeting peak solids production or to assist in handling sludge during wet weather. The disadvantage of bottom sand layers compared to conventional drying beds is that the bot-tom sand layers can plug up or \u201cblind\u2019\u2019 with multiple loadings, thereby increasing the required surface area. Polymer treatment can be useful in preventing this sand blinding. Storage lagoons, which are generally earthen basins, have no size limitations but have been designed in areas from 2,000 to 60,000 m\n2, ranging in depth from 2 to 10 or \nmore meters. Storage and dewatering lagoons may be equipped with inlet structures designed to dissipate the velocity of the incoming sludge. This minimizes turbulence in the lagoons and helps prevent carryover of solids in the decant. The lagoon outlet structure is designed to skim the settled supernatant and is sometimes provided with flash boards to vary the draw-off depths. Any design of a storage lagoon must consider how the sludge will be ultimately removed unless the site is to be abandoned. The basis for design of dewatering lagoons is essentially the same as that for sand drying beds. The difference is that the applied depth is high and the number of applica-tions per year is greatly reduced.\nSand-Drying Beds.  Sand-drying beds operate on the simple principle of spreading \nthe sludge out and letting it dry. As much water as possib"}

Sand-drying beds have been built simply by cleaning an area of land, dumping the sludge, and hoping something happens. At the other end of the spectrum sophisticated automated drying systems have been built. Drying beds may be roughly categorized as follows:\n 1. Conventional rectangular beds with side walls and a layer of sand on gravel \nwith underdrain piping to carry away the liquid. They are built either with or \nwithout provisions for mechanical removal of the dried sludge and with or without a roof or a greenhouse-type covering (see Figure 6-48).\n. 2. Paved rectangular drying beds with a center sand drainage strip with or with-\nout heating pipes buried in the paved section and with or without covering to prevent incursion of rain.\n 3. \u201cWedge-water\u201d drying beds that include a wedge wire septum incorporating \nprovision for an initial flo"}

Rectangular vacuum-assisted drying beds with provision for application of \nvacuum to assist gravity drainage.\n The dewatering of sludge on sand beds is accomplished by two major factors: drainage and evaporation. The removal of water from sludge by drainage is a two-step process. First, the water is drained from the sludge, into the sand, and out the underd-rains. This process may last a few days until the sand is clogged with fine particles or until all the free water has drained away. Further drainage by decanting can occur once a supernatant layer has formed (if beds are provided with a means of removing surface water). Decanting for removal of rain water can also be particularly important with sludges that do not crack.Sludge\nDrainageCollection\nsystemSplash slabSide wall\nSand\nGravelGate\n FIGURE 6-48\nTypical sludge drying bed construction.

{"text": "enix would be a more efficient area for a sand bed than Seattle! Much of the lower Midwest, for example, would have an annual evaporation rate of about 0.75 m, so typical annual loadings to a sand bed in that area would be 100  kg/m\n2?y. This may be applied and cleaned in about 10 cycles during the year.\n The filtrate from the sand-drying beds can be either recycled, treated, or dis-charged to a watercourse depending on its quality. Laboratory testing of the filtrate should be performed in conjunction with sand-drying bed pilot testing before a deci-sion is made as to what is to be done with it. Current United States practice is to make drying beds rectangular with dimensions of 4 to 20 m by 15 to 50 m with vertical side walls. Usually 100 to 230 mm of sand is placed over 200 to 460 mm of graded gravel or stone. The sand is usually 0.3 to 1.2 mm in effective diameter and has a uniformity coefficient less than 5.0. Gravel is normally graded from 3 to 25 mm in effective diameter. Underdrain piping has normally been of vitrified clay, but plastic pipe is also becoming acceptable. The pipes should be no less than 100 mm in diameter, should be spaced 2.2 to 6 m apart, and should have a mini-mum slope of 1 percent. When the cost of labor is high, newly constructed beds are designed for mechanical sludge removal.\nFreeze Treatment.  Dewatering sludge by either of the nonmechanical methods may \nbe enhanced by physical conditioning of the sludge through alternate natural freezing and t"}
{"text": "hawing cycles. The freeze-thaw process dehydrates the sludge particles by freez-ing the water that is closely associated with the particles. The dewatering process takes place in two stages. The first stage reduces sludge volume by selectively freezing the water molecules. Next, the solids are dehydrated when they become frozen. When thawed, the solid mass forms granular-shaped particles. This coarse material readily settles and retains its new size and shape. This residue sludge dewaters rapidly and makes suitable landfill material. The supernatant liquid from this process can be decanted, leaving the solids to dewater by natural drainage and evaporation. Pilot-scale systems can be utilized to evaluate this method\u2019s effectiveness and to establish design parameters. Elimination of rain and snow from the dewatering system by the provision of a roof will enhance the process considerably. The potential advantages of a freeze-thaw system are\n 1. Insensitivity to variations in sludge quality\n 2. No conditioning required\n 3. Minimum operator attention\n 4. Natural process in cold climates (winter)\n 5. Solids cake more acceptable at landfills\n 6. Sludge easily worked with conventional equipment\n Several natural freeze-thaw installations are located in New York state.

The sludge has \nnever been deeper than 300 mm during freezing because of additional water losses. The 300 mm sludge layer reduces to about 75 mm of dried material after freeze-thaw.\nCentrifuging.   A centrifuge uses centrifugal force to speed up the separation of \nsludge particles from the liquid. In a typical unit (Figure 6-49), sludge is pumped into \na horizontal, cylindrical bowl, rotating at 800 to 2,000 rpm. Polymers used for sludge conditioning also are injected into the centrifuge. The solids are spun to the outside of the bowl where they are scraped out by a screw conveyor. The liquid, or centrate, is \nreturned to the treatment plant. Two types of centrifuges are currently used for sludge dewatering: the solid bowl and the basket bowl. For dewatering water-treatment-plant sludges, the solid bowl has proven to be more successful than the basket bowl. Centri-fuges are very sensitive to changes in the concentration or composition of the sludge, as well as to the amount of polymer applied. Because of its calcium carbonate content, lime softening-sludge dewaters with relative ease in a centrifuge. A cake dryness of 20 to 25 percent can be achieved for a centrifuged alum s"}

A vacuum filter consists of a cylindrical drum covered with a \nfiltering material or fabric, which rotates partially submerged in a vat of conditioned sludge (Figure 6-50). A vacuum is applied inside the drum to extract water, leaving the solids, or filter cake, on the filter medium. As the drum completes its rotational cycles, a blade scrapes the filter cake from the filter and the cycle begins again. Two basic types of rotary-drum vacuum filters are used in water treatment: the traveling medium  \nand the precoat medium filters. The traveling medium filter is made of fabric or stain-less steel coils. This filter is continuously removed from the drum, allowing it to be washed from both sides without diluting the sludge in the sludge vat. The precoat me-dium filter is coated with 50 to 75 mm of inert material, which is shaved off in 0.1\u00a0mm increments as the drum moves.Drive sheave\nFeed\nSolid\ndischargeLiquid\ndischargeGear boxRotating bowl\n FIGURE 6-49\nSolid bowl centrifuge.

The device employs \ndouble moving belts to continuously dewater sludges through one or more stages of \ndewatering (Figure 6-51). Typically the CBFP includes the following stages of \ntreatment:\n 1. A reactor/conditioner to remove free-draining water\n 2.

Cake breakers are usually required to break up the rigid cake into \nconveyable form. Because recessed-plate pressure filters operate at high pressures and because many units use lime for conditioning, the cloths require routine washing with high-pressure water, as well as periodic washing with acid. The Erie County Water Authority\u2019s Sturgeon Point Plant in Erie County, New York, and the Monroe County Water Authority\u2019s Shoremont Plant in Rochester, New York, serve as typical examples of the application of filter presses. Both plants include gravity settling and chemical conditioning of the sludge followed by mechanical dewatering via pressure plate filtration. A typical process flow diagram of the sludge treatment system used at both plants is shown in Figure 6-53.

{"text": " them. Activities such as fishing, swimming, boating, shipping, and waste disposal have very different requirements for water quality. Water of a particularly high quality is needed for potable water supplies. In many parts of the world, the introduction of pollutants from human activity has seriously degraded  water quality even to the extent of turning pristine trout streams into foul open sewers with few life forms and fewer beneficial uses. Water quality management is concerned with the control of pollution from human activity so that the water is not degraded to the point that it is no longer suitable for in-tended uses. The lone frontier family, settled on the banks of the Ohio River, did not significantly degrade water quality in that mighty river even though it threw all its wastes into the river. The city of Cincinnati, however, could not discharge its untreated wastes into the Ohio River without disastrous consequences. Thus, water quality management is also the science of knowing how much is too much for a particular water body. To know how much waste can be tolerated (the technical term is assimilated ) by a \nwater body, you must know the type of pollutants discharged and the manner in which they affect water quality. You must also know how water quality is affected by natural factors such as the mineral heritage of the watershed, the geometry of the terrain, and the climate of the region. A small, tumbling mountain brook will have a very different assimilative ca"}

Originally, the intent of water quality management was to protect the intended uses of a water body while using water as an economic means of waste disposal within the constraints of its assimilative capacity. In 1972, the Congress of the United States established that it was in the national interest to \u201crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation\u2019s waters.\u201d In addition to making the water safe to drink, the Congress also established a goal of \u201cwater quality which pro-vides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife, and provides for recreation in and on the water\u201d (FWPCA, 1972). By understanding the impact of pollutants on water quality, the environmental engineer can properly design the treat-ment facilities to remove these pollutants to acceptable levels. This chapter deals first with the major types of pollutants and their sources. In the remainder of the chapter, pollution in rivers, lakes, and groundwater is discussed, plac-ing the emphasis on the categories of pollutants found in domestic wastewaters. For both rivers and lakes, the natural factors affecting water quality will be discussed as the basis for understanding the impact of human activities on water quality.\nApplications\nThis chapter has both qualitative and quantitative applications.

Domestic sewage and industrial wastes are called point sources because they are generally collected by a network of pipes or channels and conveyed to a single point of discharge into the receiving water. Domestic sewage consists of wastes from homes, schools, office buildings, and stores. The term munici-pal sewage is used to mean domestic sewage into which industrial wastes are also discharged. Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 some animal feeding opera-tions (AFOs) may be "}
{"text": "designated as a point source. AFOs are designated point sources if the feeding operation may be classified as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO). The regulations define AFOs as facilities where animals are fed and confined for 45 days or more in any 12-consecutive-month period, and where crops, vegetation, forage growth, or postharvest residues are not grown or sustained in the feedlot or facility. The latter requirement is to distinguish feedlots from pastures. To qualify as a CAFO (and, \nTABLE 7-1\nMajor pollutant categories and principal sources of pollutants          \n   Point sources   Non-point sources    \nPollutant   Domestic   Industrial   Agricultural   Urban      \ncategory sewage wastes runoff runoff\nOxygen-demanding material   X   X   X   X    \nNutrients   X   X   X   X    \nPathogens   X   X   X   X    \nSuspended solids/sediments   X   X   X   X    \nSalts      X    X    X     \nToxic metals      X      X    \nToxic organic chemicals        X X      \nEndocrine-disrupting chemicals X     X   X      \nPharmaceuticals X     X   X      \nPersonal care products X   \nHeat      X           dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 390  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 390  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER POLLUTION   391\nthus, be a point source) an AFO must meet one of three criteria (DiMura, 2003): (1) all \nAFOs with"}
{"text": " 1,000 animal units* or more are CAFOs, (2)\u00a0AFOs with between 300 and 1,000 animal units that discharge directly or indirectly to surface waters are CAFOs (AFOs with less than 300 animal units may not be classified as CAFOs), and (3) any AFO may be designated a CAFO if it is found to contribute significantly to pollution of surface waters. In general, point source pollution can be reduced or eliminated through waste min-imization and proper wastewater treatment prior to discharge to a natural water body.\nNon-Point Sources\nUrban and agricultural runoff are characterized by multiple discharge points. These are called non-point sources. Often the polluted water flows over the surface of the land or along natural drainage channels to the nearest water body. Even when urban or agri-cultural runoff waters are collected in pipes or channels, they are generally transported the shortest possible distance for discharge, so that wastewater treatment at each outlet is not economically feasible. Much of the non-point source pollution occurs during rainstorms or spring snowmelt resulting in large flow rates that make treatment even more difficult. Non-point pollution from urban storm water and, in particular, storm water collected in combined sewers that carry both storm water and municipal sewage requires major engineering work to correct. The original design of combined sewers provided a flow structure that diverted excess storm water mixed with raw sewage (above the design capacity of t"}
{"text": "he wastewater treatment plant) directly to the nearest river or stream. The elimination of combined sewer overflow (CSO) may involve not only provision of separate storm and sanitary sewers but also the provision of storm water retention basins and expanded treatment facilities to treat the storm water. This is particularly complex and expensive because the combined sewers frequently occur in the oldest, most developed portions of the community. Thus, paved streets, utilities, and commercial activities will be disrupted. The installation of combined sewers is now prohibited in the United States. Runoff from agricultural land is a significant non-point source. Fertilizer, whether in the form of manure or commercial fertilizer, contributes nutrients. Agricultural runoff carries nutrients and toxic organic compounds. Soil erosion contributes sus-pended solids. Implementation of Best Management Practices  (BMP) to reduce  excess \napplication of fertilizer and pesticides along with erosion control programs conserves the farmers economic investment while protecting the river.\nOxygen-Demanding Material\nAnything that can be oxidized in the receiving water with the consumption of dis-solved molecular oxygen is termed oxygen-demanding material. This material is usu-ally biodegradable organic matter but also includes certain inorganic compounds. The consumption of dissolved oxygen, DO (pronounced \u201cdee oh\u201d), poses a threat to fish and other higher forms of aquatic life that must have oxy"}

For example, brook trout may require about \n *Generally, one animal unit is equal to 450 kg of live animal mass.    dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 391  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 391  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles392  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n7.5 mg/L of DO, while carp may survive at 3 mg/L. As a rule, the\u00a0most desirable com-\nmercial and game fish require high levels of dissolved oxygen. Oxygen-demanding \nmaterials in domestic sewage come primarily from human waste and food residue. Particularly noteworthy among the many industries that produce  oxygen-demanding wastes are the food processing and paper industries. Almost any naturally occurring organic matter, such as animal droppings, crop residues, or leaves, that get into the water from non-point sources, contribute to the depletion of DO.\nNutrients\nNitrogen and phosphorus, two nutrients of primary concern, are considered pollutants because they are too much of a good thing. All living things require these nutrients for growth. Thus, they must be present in rivers and lakes to support the\u00a0natural food chain.* Problems arise when nutrient levels become excessive and the food web is grossly disturbed, which causes some organisms to proliferate at the expense of others. As will b"}
{"text": "e discussed in a later section, excessive nutrients often lead to large growths of algae, which in turn become oxygen-demanding material when they die and settle to the bottom. Some major sources of nutrients are phosphorus-based detergents, fer-tilizers, and food-processing wastes.\nPathogenic Organisms\nMicroorganisms found in wastewater include bacteria, viruses, and protozoa excreted by diseased persons or animals. When discharged into surface waters, they make the water unfit for drinking (that is, nonpotable). If the  concentration of pathogens is suffi-ciently high, the water may also be unsafe for  swimming and fishing. Certain shellfish can be toxic because they concentrate pathogenic organisms in their tissues, making the toxicity levels in the shellfish much greater than the levels in the surrounding water. Cholera and typhoid are endemic diseases in the world with over 384,000 cases \nof\u00a0cholera and 16 million cases of typhoid per year. These killers cause 20,000 and 600,000 deaths per year respectively (Population Reports, 1998). Yet, in the United States, they are unheard of outside of a historic context. The widespread disease- causing organisms in the United States are Giardia lambia  and Cryptosporidium \nparvum . These are protozoan pathogens from both human and animal sources.\n Bacteria that have developed immunity to antibiotics are now being found in natu-ral waters (Ash et al., 1999; Sternes, 1999; Bennett and Kramer, 1999). The resistance of the bacteria ap"}
{"text": "pearing in natural waters is an ominous prelude to the future effec-tiveness of antibiotics.\nSuspended Solids\nOrganic and inorganic particles that are carried by the wastewater into a receiving water are termed suspended solids (SS). When the speed of the water is reduced by flowing into a pool or a lake, many of these particles settle to the bottom as sediment. \n *In simplistic terms, a food chain is the collection of interrelated organisms in which the lower levels are the \n \u201ceatees \u201d and the upper levels are the  \u201ceaters. \u201d     dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 392  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 392  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER POLLUTION   393\nIn common usage, the word sediment also includes eroded soil particles that are being \ncarried by water even if they have not yet settled. Colloidal particles, that do not settle readily, cause the turbidity found in many surface waters. Organic suspended solids may also exert an oxygen demand. Inorganic suspended solids are discharged by some industries but result mostly from soil erosion, which is particularly bad in areas of log-ging, strip mining, and construction activity. As excessive sediment loads are depos-ited into lakes and reservoirs, the usefulness of the water is reduced. Even in rapidly moving mountain streams, sediment from mining and logging operations "}
{"text": "has de-stroyed many living places (ecological habitats) for aquatic organisms. For example, salmon eggs can only develop and hatch in stream beds of loose gravel. As the pores between the pebbles are filled with sediment, the eggs suffocate and the salmon popu-lation is reduced.\nSalts\nAlthough most people associate salty water with oceans and salt lakes, all  water con-tains some salt. These salts are often measured by evaporation of a filtered water sam-ple. The salts and other things that don\u2019t evaporate are called total dissolved solids  \n(TDS). A problem arises when the salt concentration in normally fresh water increases to the point where the natural population of plants and animals is threatened or the water is no longer useful for public water supplies or irrigation. High concentrations of salts are discharged by many industries, and the use of salt on roads during the winter causes high salt levels in urban runoff, especially during the spring snowmelt. Of par-ticular concern in arid regions, where water is used extensively for irrigation, is that the water picks up salts every time it passes through the soil on its way back to the river. In addition, evapotranspiration causes the salts to be further concentrated. Thus, the salt concentration continuously increases as the water moves downstream. If the concentration gets too high, crop damage or soil poisoning can result.\nPharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs)\nThese are a class of compounds that are appli"}
{"text": "ed externally or ingested by humans, pets, and other domesticated animals. They are released to the environment through the disposal of expired, unwanted, or excess medications to the sewage system by in-dividuals, pharmacies, or physicians. Another source of PPCPs in the environment is through metabolic excretion\u2014the excretion of the chemically unaltered parent com-pound and metabolized by-products in urine and feces. PCPs, such as deodorants and sunscreens, can be washed into our waterways during bathing, washing, and swim-ming. Some PCPs are also used as pest-control agents! The presence of pharmaceuticals in raw and treated wastewater has been well documented with concentrations averaging from less than 10 m g/L in finished waste-\nwater to greater than 100 m g/L in raw wastewater. Examples of pharmaceuticals that \nhave been detected in wastewater are common prescription and veterinary drugs such as beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, propranolol), analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen), and antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, tetracylcline, clindo-mycin, sulfonamides, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, macrolides, and trimethoprim) (Hullman, 2009).dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 393  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 393  13/10/11  5:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles394  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n "}
{"text": "CAFOs commonly administer antibiotics and hormones to livestock for disease \ncontrol and added into feed at subtherapeutic levels to improve the feeding efficiency, growth rate, and animal health. About 11,400 megagrams (Mg) or 70 percent of anti-biotics produced for medical and agricultural purposes in the United States are used for nontherapeutic treatment of livestock (Mellon et al., 2001). As much as 75 percent of the antibiotics used for animal growth are excreted back into manure (Campagnolo et al., 2002), of which the United States produces 266 gigagrams (Gg) of dry weight per year (Burkholder et al., 2007). The most common growth promoters of livestock are tetracycline, chlorotetracycline, and bacitracen (Jindal et al., 2006; Mackie et al., 2006). All of the antibiotics listed above are also used in human therapy. After a period of storage, manure is often land-applied as plant fertilizer, and as consequence the pharmaceuticals are discharged to surface and ground water via surface runoff and percolation. Personal care products (PCPs) such as hand and dish soap, oral hygiene products, and air fresheners, may contain compounds such as triclosan (a registered pesticide), phthalates, and phenols. Seven carcinogenic compounds that are commonly found in PCPs are hydroquinone, ethylene dioxide, formaldehyde, nitrosamine, acrylamides, and PAHs. Hydroquinone was found in products used by 94 percent of women and 69 percent of men. All of these compounds have been found in raw "}

Some naturally occurring EDCs, such as 17 b-estradiol that is both a naturally occurring estrogen and a synthetic estrogen used as a method of birth control, are ex-creted into wastewater. Other EDCs include the polychlorinated biphenyls, commonly used pesticides such as atrazine and other triazine chemicals, and the phthalates. EDCs can mimic estrogens, androgens, or thyroid hormones, or their antagonists, although the structures of many EDCs bear little resemblance to that of natural hormones with which they interfere. They can also interfere with the regulation of reproductive and developmental processes in mammals, birds, reptiles and fish (Sadik and Witt, 1999; Harries et al., 2000). The chemicals can also alter the normal physiological function of the endocrine system and can affect the synthesis of hormones in the body. EDCs can also target tissues where the hormones exert their effects.

In a study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) of 20 national water quality assessment program (NAWQA) study units across the coun-try, it was found that more than 90 percent of water and fish samples from all streams contained one or, more often, several pesticides. The most commonly oc-curring pesticides found in water were primarily those currently in use, whereas those found in fish and sediment are the organochlorine insecticides, such as DDT, that were heavily used decades ago. About 50 percent of the wells sampled con-tained one or more pesticides, with the highest detection frequencies in shallow groundwater beneath agricultural and urban areas and the lowest frequencies in deeper aquifers (U.S.G.S., 1999).\nHeat\nAlthough heat is not often recognized as a pollutant, those in the electric power indus-try are well aware of the problems of disposing of waste heat.

However, controlling waste discharges must be a quantitative en-deavor. We must be able to measure the pollutants, predict the impact of the pollutant on water quality, determine the background water quality that would be present without human intervention, and decide the levels acceptable for intended uses of the water. To most people, the tumbling mountain brook, crystal clear and icy cold, fed by the melting snow, and safe to drink is the epitome of high water quality. Certainly a stream in that condition is a treasure, but we cannot expect the Mississippi River to have the same water quality. It never did and never will. Yet both need proper manage-ment if the water is to remain usable for intended purposes. The mountain brook may serve as the spawning ground for desirable fish and must be protected from heat and sediment as well as chemical pollution. The Mississippi, however, is already warmed from hundreds of kilometers of exposure to the sun and carries the sediment from thousands of square kilometers of land. But even the Mississippi can be damaged by organic matter and toxic chemicals. Fis"}

The impact of pollution on a river depends both on the nature of the pollutant and the unique characteristics of the individual river.* Some of the most important characteristics include the volume and speed of water flowing in the river, the river\u2019s depth, the type of bottom, and the surrounding vegetation. Other factors include the climate of the region, the mineral heritage of the watershed, land use patterns, and the types of aquatic life in the river. Water quality management for a particular river must consider all these factors. Thus, some rivers are highly susceptible to pollutants such as sediment, salt, and heat, while other rivers can tolerate large inputs of these pollutants without much damage.\nTotal Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)\nUnder Section 303(d) of the 1972 Clean Water Act, states, territories, and authorized tribes are required to develop lists of impaired waters. Impaired waters are those that \ndo not meet water quality standards that the states, territories, and authorized tribes have established for them. This assessment is made after assuming that point sources of pollution have installed minimum levels of pollution control technology. The law  requires that these jurisdictions establish priority rankings for waters on the lists and develop total maximum daily loads (TMDL) for these waters.

This poses a threat to fish and other higher forms of aquatic life if the concentration of oxygen falls below a critical point. To predict the extent of oxygen depletion, it is necessary to know how much waste is being discharged and how much oxygen will be required to degrade the waste. However, because oxygen is continuously being replenished from the atmo-sphere and from photosynthesis by algae and aquatic plants, as well as being con-sumed by organisms, the concentration of oxygen in the river is determined by the relative rates of these competing processes. Organic oxygen-demanding materials are commonly measured by determining the amount of oxygen consumed during degrada-tion in a manner approximating degradation in natural waters. This section begins by considering the factors affecting oxygen consumption during the degradation of or-ganic matter, then moves on to inorganic nitrogen oxidation. Finally, the equations for predicting dissolved oxygen concentrations in rivers from degradation of organic mat-ter are developed and discussed.\nBiochemical Oxygen Demand\nThe amount of oxygen required to oxidize a substance"}

This amount of oxygen is known as the theoretical oxygen demand  (ThOD). \nThe calculation of ThOD is illustrated in Example 7-2.\nExample 7-2.

In the COD test, a strong chemical oxidizing agent (chromic acid) is mixed with a water sample and then boiled. The difference between the amount of oxidizing agent at the beginning of the test and that remaining at the end of the test is used to calcul"}
{"text": "ate the COD. If the oxidation of an organic compound is carried out by microorganisms using the organic matter as a food source, the oxygen consumed is known as biochemical oxygen demand, or BOD (pronounced \u201cbee oh dee\u201d). The actual BOD is less than the ThOD due to the incorporation of some of the carbon into new bacterial cells. The test is a bioassay that utilizes microorganisms in conditions similar to those in natural  water to measure indirectly the amount of biodegradable organic matter present. Bioassay  means to mea-\nsure by biological means. A water sample is inoculated with bacteria that consume the biodegradable organic matter to obtain energy for their life processes. Because the organ-isms also utilize oxygen in the process of consuming the waste, the process is called aerobic  \ndecomposition. This oxygen consumption is easily measured. The greater the amount of organic matter present, the greater the amount of oxygen utilized. The BOD test is an indirect measurement of organic matter because we actually measure only the change in dissolved oxygen concentration caused by the microorganisms as they degrade the or-ganic matter. Although not all organic matter is biodegradable and the actual test proce-dures lack precision, the BOD test is still the most widely used method of measuring organic matter because of the direct conceptual relationship between BOD and oxygen depletion in receiving waters. Only under rare circumstances will the ThOD, COD, and BOD be equal. "}
{"text": "If the chemical composition of all of the substances in the water is known and they are ca-pable of being completely oxidized both chemically and biologically, then the three measures of oxygen demand will be the same. When a water sample containing degradable organic matter is placed in a closed container and inoculated with bacteria, the oxygen consumption typically follows the pattern shown in Figure 7-2.

Any given microorganism is limited in its \nability to utilize organic compounds. As a consequence, many organic compounds can \nbe degraded by only a small group of microorganisms. In a natural environment re-ceiving a continuous discharge of organic waste, that population of organisms which can most efficiently utilize this waste will predominate. However, the culture used to inoculate the BOD test may contain only a very small number of organisms that can degrade the particular organic compounds in the waste. This problem is especially common when analyzing industrial wastes. The result is that the BOD rate constant is lower in the laboratory test than in the natural water. This is an undesirable outcome. The BOD test should therefore be conducted with organisms that have been accli-mated to the waste so that the rate constant determined in the laboratory can be com-pared to that in the river.*\nTemperature.  Most biological processes speed up as the temperature increases \nand\u00a0slow down as the temperature drops.

{"text": "NEERING\nLaboratory Measurement of Biochemical Oxygen Demand\nIn order to have as much consistency as possible, it is important to standardize testing \nprocedures when measuring BOD. In the paragraphs that follow, the standard BOD \ntest is outlined with emphasis placed on the reason for each step rather than the details. \nThe detailed procedures can be found in Standard Methods for the Examination of \nWater and Wastewater  (APHA, 2005) which is the authoritative reference of testing \nprocedures in the water pollution control field.\nStep 1.   A special 300 mL BOD bottle (Figure 7-4) is completely filled with a sample \nof water that has been appropriately diluted and inoculated with microorganisms. The \nbottle is then stoppered to exclude air bubbles. Samples require dilution because the \nonly oxygen available to the organisms is dissolved in the water. The most oxygen that \ncan dissolve is about 9 mg/L, so the BOD of the diluted sample should be between 2 \nand 6 mg/L. Samples are diluted with a special dilution water that contains all of the \ntrace  elements required for bacterial metabolism so that degradation of the organic mat-\nter is not limited by lack of bacterial growth. The  dilution water also contains an \n inoculum of microorganisms so that all samples tested on a given day contain approxi-\nmately the same type and number of  microorganisms.\nFIGURE 7-4 \nBOD bottles. The bottle on the left is shown with the cap removed to illustrate the shape of the glass stoppers. \nThe"}

Blank samples containing only the inoculated dilution water are also placed in \nBOD bottles and stoppered.

The stoppered BOD bottles containing diluted samples and blanks are in-cubated in the dark at 208 C for the desired number of days. For most purposes, a \n standard time of five days is used. To determine the ultimate BOD and the BOD rate constant, additional times are used.

After the desired number of days has elapsed, the samples and blanks are re-\nmoved from the incubator and the dissolved oxygen concentration in each bottle is mea-sured.

If \nthe dilution water is seeded then a correction factor for the oxygen depletion due the seed is required (APHA, 2005).\nAdditional Notes on Biochemical Oxygen Demand\nAlthough the 5-day BOD has been chosen as the standard value for most wastewater analysis and for regulatory purposes, ultimate BOD is actually a better indicator of total waste strength.

The ultimate BOD calculated from Equation 7-4 is, therefore, 68 mg/L. \nHowever, because the river temperature is 9\u00b0C, the k  value in the river is only 0.076 d21. \nAs shown graphically in Figure 7-6, the laboratory value of BOD 5 seriously overesti-\nmates the actual oxygen consumption in the river. Again, for a constant ultimate BOD, a smaller fraction of the BOD is exerted in five days when the BOD rate constant is lower. The 5-day BOD was chosen as the standard value for most purposes because the test was devised by environmental engineers in England, where rivers have travel times to the sea of less than 5 days, so there was no need to consider oxygen demand at longer times. Since there is no other time that is any more rational than 5 days, this value has become firmly entrenched.*\nNitrogen Oxidation\nUp to this point an unstated assumption has been that only the carbon in organic  matter is oxidized.

For example, one expla-nation is that after five days, the microbial system in the BOD bottle is in the autodigestive phase. That is, there is no carbon source outside of the microbial cells that they can consume and that any oxygen uptake that occurs beyond five days is the result of consumption of carbon that they have stored (Gaudy and Gaudy, 1980).     dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 409  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 409  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles410  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nmechanisms and rates of nitrogen oxidation are distinctly different from those of car-\nbon oxidation, the two processes must be considered separately. Logically, oxygen consumption due to oxidation of carbon is called carbonaceous BOD (CBOD), while that due to nitrogen oxidation is called nitrogenous BOD (NBOD). The organisms that oxidize the carbon in organic compounds to obtain energy cannot oxidize the nitrogen in these compounds. Instead, the nitrogen is released into the surrounding water as ammonia (NH\n3). At normal pH values, this ammonia is actu-\nally in the form of the ammonium cation 1NH1\n42.

In the case of untreated sewage, the NBOD is exerted after much of the CBOD has been exerted. The lag is due to the time it takes for the nitrifying bacteria to reach a sufficient population for the amount of NBOD exertion to be sig-nificant compared with that of the CBOD. In the case of the treated sewage, a higher population of nitrifying organisms in the sample reduces the lag time. Once nitrifica-tion begins, however, the NBOD can be described by Equations 7-4 and 7-5 with a BOD rate constant comparable to that for the CBOD of a well-treated effluent (k  5 \n0.12 to 0.23 d\n21). Because the lag before the nitrogenous BOD is highly variable, \nBOD 5 values are often difficult to interpret.

{"text": "s-ing Equation 7-6.\nStreeter-Phelps DO Sag Curve\nThe concentration of dissolved oxygen in a river is an indicator of the general health of the river. All rivers have some capacity for self-purification. As long as the discharge of oxygen-demanding wastes is well within the self-purification capacity, the DO level will remain high and a diverse population of plants and animals, including game fish, can be found. As the amount of waste increases, the self-purification capacity can be  exceeded, causing detrimental changes in plant and animal life. The stream loses its ability to cleanse itself and the DO level decreases. When the DO drops below about 4\u00a0to 5 mg/L, most game fish will have been driven out. If the DO is completely removed, fish and other higher animals are killed or driven out and extremely noxious conditions result. The water becomes blackish and foul smelling as the sewage and dead animal life de-compose under anaerobic conditions (that is, without oxygen). One of the major tools of water quality management in rivers is the ability to  assess the capability of a stream to absorb a waste load.

As depicted in Figure 7-9, the biota of the stream are often a reflection of the dissolved oxygen conditions in the stream. To develop a mathematical expression for the DO sag curve, the sources of oxygen and the factors affecting oxygen depletion must be identified and quantified. The only significant sources of oxygen are reaeration from the atmosphere and photosynthesis of aquatic plants. Oxygen depletion is caused by a larger range of factors, the most im-portant being the BOD, both carbonaceous and nitrogenous, of the waste discharge, \nand the BOD already in the river upstream of the waste discharge. The second most important factor is that the DO in the waste discharge is usually less than that in the river. Thus, the DO at the river is lowered as soon as the waste is added, even before any BOD is exerted. Other factors affecting dissolved oxygen depletion include non-point source pollution, the respiration of organisms living in the sediments ( benthic de-\nmand ), and the respiration of aquatic plants. Following the classical approach, the DO \nsag equation (also know"}
{"text": "n as the Streeter- Phelps equation in recognition of the engi-\nneers who developed it) will be developed by considering only initial DO reduction, carbonaceous BOD, and reaeration from the atmosphere (Streeter-Phelps, 1925). Sub-sequently, the equation will be expanded to include the nitrogenous BOD. Finally, the other factors affecting DO levels will be discussed qualitatively; a quantitative discus-sion is beyond the scope of this book.\nMass Balance Approach.  Simplified mass balances help us understand and solve \nthe DO sag curve problem. Three conservative (those without chemical reaction) mass balances may be used to account for initial mixing of the waste stream and the river. DO, carbonaceous BOD, and temperature all change as the result of mixing of the waste stream and the river. Once these are accounted for, the DO sag curve may be viewed as a nonconservative mass balance, that is, one with reactions.10\n8\n64\n2\n24\nTravel Time, d68 1 0Dissolved Oxygen, mg/LInitial\nDeficit (Da)\ntcSaturation DO (DOs)\nCritical\nPointDeficit (D)\nDO Concentration (DO)\nFIGURE 7-8 \nTypical Streeter-Phelps DO sag curve.    dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 412  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 412  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesClean Zone\nTrout, perch, bass;\nmayfly, stonefly, and\ncaddisfly larvaeDecomposition Zone\nTrash fish; blackfly and\nm"}

The DO sag equation has been developed using oxygen deficit \nrather than dissolved oxygen concentration, to make it easier to solve the integral equation that results from the mathematical description of the mass balance.

Calculate the initial deficit of the Bald Eagle Creek after mixing with \nthe wastewater from the town of State College (see Example 7-9 for data). The stream temperature is 108C and the wastewater temperature is 108C.\nSolution.  With the stream temperature, the saturation value of dissolved oxygen \n(DO\ns) can be determined from the table in Appendix A. At 108 C, DO s 5 11.33 mg/L. \nSince we calculated the concentration of DO after mixing as 4.75 mg/L in  Example 7-9, the initial deficit after mixing is\nD\na511.33 mg/L 24.75 mg/L 56.58 mg/L\n Because wastewater commonly has a higher temperature than river water, espe-cially during the winter, the river temperature downstream of the discharge is usually higher than that upstream. Since we are interested in downstream conditions, it is im-portant to use the downstream temperature when determining the saturation concentra-tion of dissolved oxygen.\nDO Sag Equation.

As noted in Chapter 4, modeling equations may predict im-\npossible results. This is true for the Streeter-Phelps model. For example, if the deficit calculated from Equation 7-41 is greater than the DO saturation, the result will be a negative number. Because it is physically impossible for the DO to be less than zero, this means that all the oxygen was depleted at some point upstream and the DO is zero. Assuming your calculations are correct, you must use your engineering judgment and report it as zero because it cannot be less than zero! In some instances there may not be a sag in the DO downstream. The lowest DO may occur in the mixing zone. In these instances Equation 7-46 will not give a useful value.

The beginning point for water quality management in rivers \nusing the DO sag curve is to determine the minimum DO concentration that will pro-tect the aquatic life in the stream. This value, called the DO standard, is generally set to protect the most sensitive species that exist or could exist in the particular river. For a known waste discharge and a known set of river charact"}
{"text": "eristics, the DO sag equation can be solved to find the DO at the critical point. If this value is higher than the stan-dard, the stream can adequately assimilate the waste. If the DO at the critical point is less than the standard, then additional waste treatment is needed. Usually, the environ-mental engineer has control over just two parameters, L\na and D a. By increasing the \nefficiency of the existing treatment processes or by adding additional treatment steps, the ultimate BOD of the waste discharge can be reduced, thereby reducing L\na. Often a \nrelatively inexpensive method for improving stream quality is to reduce D a by adding \noxygen to the wastewater to bring it close to saturation prior to discharge. To deter-mine whether a proposed improvement will be adequate, the new values for L\na and D a \nare used to determine whether the DO standard will be violated at the critical point. Under unusual conditions, the engineer may artificially aerate the river with mechani-cal systems to increase the DO. When using the DO sag curve to determine the adequacy of wastewater treatment, it is important to use the river conditions that will cause the lowest DO concentration. Usually these conditions occur in the late summer when river flows are low and tem-peratures are high. A frequently used criterion is the \u201c10-year, 7-day low flow,\u201d which is the recurrence interval return period of the average low flow for a 7-day  period.

Up to this point, only carbonaceous BOD has been consid-\nered in\u00a0the DO sag curve. However, in many cases nitrogenous BOD has at least as much impact on dissolved oxygen levels. Modern wastewater treatment plants can dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 423  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 423  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles424  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nroutinely produce effluents with CBOD 5 of less than 30 mg/L. A typical effluent \nalso contains approximately 30 mg/L of nitrogen, which would mean an NBOD of \nabout 137 mg/L if it were discharged as ammonia (see Example 7-8).

The classical DO sag curve assumes \nthat there is only one point-source discharge of waste into the river. In reality, this is rarely the case. Multiple point sources can be handled by dividing the river up into reaches with a point source at the head of each reach. A reach is a length of river speci-fied by the engineer on the basis of its homogeneity, that is, channel shape, bottom composition, slope, and so forth. The oxygen deficit and residual BOD can be calcu-lated at the end of each reach. These values are then used to determine new values of D\na \nand La at the beginning of the following reach. Non-point source pollution can also be \nhandled this way if the reaches are made small enough. Non-point source pollution can also be incorporated directly into the DO sag equation for a more sophisticated analy-sis. Dividing the river into reaches is also necessary whenever the flow regime changes, since the reaeration coefficient would also change. In small rivers, rapids play a major role in maintaining high DO levels. Eliminating rapids by dredging or damming a river can have a severe impact on DO, although DO levels immediately downstream of dams are usually high because of the turbulence of the falling water. Some rivers contain large deposits of organic matter in the sediments. These can be natural deposits of leaves "}
{"text": "and dead aquatic plants or can be sludge deposits from wastewaters receiving little or no treatment. In either case, decomposition of this or-ganic matter places an additional burden on the stream\u2019s oxygen resources, since the oxygen demand must be supplied from the overlying water. When this benthic demand is significant, compared to the oxygen demand in the water column, it must be in-cluded quantitatively in the sag equation. Aquatic plants can also have a substantial effect on DO levels. During the day, their photosynthetic activities produce oxygen that supplements the reaeration and can even cause oxygen supersaturation. However, plants also consume oxygen for respira-tion processes. Although there is a net overall production of oxygen, plant respiration can severely lower DO levels during the night. Plant growth is usually highest in the summer when flows are low and temperatures are high, so that large nighttime respira-tion requirements coincide with the worst cases of oxygen depletion from BOD exer-tion. In addition, when aquatic plants die and settle to the bottom, they increase the benthic demand. As a general rule, large growths of aquatic plants are detrimental to the maintenance of a consistently high DO level.dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 424  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 424  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_p"}
{"text": "agefilesWATER POLLUTION   425\nEffect of Nutrients on Water Quality in Rivers\nAlthough oxygen-demanding wastes are the most important river pollutants on an \noverall basis, nutrients can also contribute to deteriorating water quality in rivers by causing excessive plant growth. Nutrients are those elements required by plants for their growth. They include, in order of abundance in plant tissue: carbon, nitrogen, phos-phorus, and a variety of trace elements. When there are sufficient quantities of all nutrients \navailable, plant growth is possible. By limiting the availability of any one nutrient, further plant growth is prevented. Some plant growth is desirable, since plants form the base of the food chain and thus support the animal community. However, excessive plant growth can create a number of undesirable conditions such as thick slime layers on rocks and dense growths of aquatic weeds. The availability of nutrients is not the only requirement for plant growth. In many rivers, the turbidity caused by eroded soil particles, bacteria, and other factors prevents light from penetrating far into the water, thereby limiting total plant growth in deep water. It is for this reason that slime growths on rocks usually occur in shallow water. Strong water currents also prevent rooted plants from taking hold, and thus limit their growth to quiet backwaters where the currents are weak and the water is shallow enough for light to penetrate.\nEffects of Nitrogen.  There are three reasons"}
{"text": " why nitrogen is detrimental to a receiv-\ning body:\n 1. In high concentrations, NH\n3-N is toxic to fish.\n 2. NH 3, in low concentrations, and NO2\n3 serve as nutrients for excessive growth \nof algae.\n 3. The conversion of NH1\n4 to NO 32 consumes large quantities of dissolved oxygen.\nEffects of Phosphorus.   The major deleterious effect of phosphorus is that it serves \nas a vital nutrient for the growth of algae. If the phosphorus availability meets the \ngrowth demands of the algae, there is an excessive production of algae. When the al-gae die, they become an oxygen-demanding organic material as bacteria seek to de-grade them. This oxygen demand frequently overtaxes the DO supply of the water body and, as a consequence, causes fish to die.\nManagement Strategy.  The strategy for managing water quality problems associ-\nated with excessive nutrients is based on the sources for each nutrient. Except under rare circumstances, there is plenty of carbon available for plant growth. Plants use carbon dioxide, which is available from the bicarbonate alkalinity of the water and from the bacterial decomposition of organic matter. As carbon dioxide is removed from the water, it is replenished from the atmosphere. Generally, the major source of trace elements is the natural weathering of rock minerals, a process over which the environmental engineer has little control. However, since the acid rain caused by air pollution accelerates the weathering process, air pollution control can help red"}

In addition, such small amounts are needed \nfor plant growth that nitrogen or phosphorus is more likely to be the limiting nutrient. Therefore, the practical control of nutrient-caused water-quality problems in streams is based on removal of nitrogen and/or phosphorus from wastewaters before they are discharged and using best management practices  (BMPs) to minimize nutrients in \nagricultural runoff.\n7-4 WATER POLLUTION IN LAKES\nOxygen-demanding wastes can also be important lake pollutants, especially when the waste is discharged to a contained area such as a bay. Pathogens are of particular con-cern near bathing beaches. Again, as with rivers, there are special classes of lakes which are most seriously affected by other pollutants such as toxic chemicals from industrial discharges. However, phosphorus so dominates other pollutants in controlling water quality in the vast majority of lakes that we will give it special emphasis. A knowledge of lake systems is essential to an understanding of the role of phos-phorus in lake pollution. The st"}
{"text": "udy of lakes is called limnology. This section is essen-tially a short course in limnology as it relates to phosphorus pollution.\nStratification and Turnover\nNearly all lakes in the temperate climatic zone become stratified during the summer and overturn (turnover) in the fall due to changes in the water temperature that result from the annual cycle of air temperature changes. In addition, lakes in cold climates undergo winter stratification and spring overturn as well. These physical processes, which are described below, occur regardless of the water quality in the lake. Nonethe-less, they do help determine the water quality. During the summer, the surface water of a lake is heated both indirectly by contact with warm air and directly by sunlight. Warm water, being less dense than cool water, remains near the surface until mixed downward by turbulence from wind, waves, boats, and other forces. Because this turbulence extends only a limited distance below the water surface, the result is an upper layer of well-mixed, warm water (the epilimnion) floating on the lower water (the hypolimnion), which is poorly mixed and cool, as \nshown in Figure 7-12a. Because of good mixing the epilimnion will be aerobic (have \nDO). The hypolimnion will have a lower DO and may become anaerobic (devoid of oxygen). The boundary is called the thermocline because of the sharp temperature change (and therefore density change) that occurs within a relatively short distance. The thermocline may be defi"}
{"text": "ned as a change in temperature with depth that is greater than 18 C/m. You may have experienced the thermocline while swimming in a small \nlake. As long as you are swimming horizontally, the water is warm, but as soon as you tread water or dive, the water turns cold. You have penetrated the thermocline. The depth of the epilimnion is related to the size of the lake. It is as little as one meter in small lakes and as much as 20 meters or more in large lakes. The depth of the epilim-nion is also related to storm activity in the spring when stratification is developing. A major storm at the right time will mix warmer water to a substantial depth and thus create a deeper than normal epilimnion. Once formed, lake stratification is very stable. dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 426  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 426  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER POLLUTION   427\nIt can be broken only by exceedingly violent storms. In fact, as the summer progresses, \nthe stability increases because the epilimnion continues to warm, while the hypolim-nion remains at a fairly constant temperature. In the fall, as temperatures drop, the epilimnion cools until it is more dense than the hypolimnion. The surface water then sinks, causing overturning. The water of the hypolimnion rises to the surface where it cools and again sinks. The lake thu"}
{"text": "s becomes completely mixed. If the lake is in a cold climate, this process stops when the tempera-ture reaches 48 C, since this is the temperature at which water is most dense. Further \ncooling or freezing of the surface water results in winter stratification, as shown in Figure 7-12b. As the water warms in the spring, it again overturns and becomes com-pletely mixed. Thus, temperate climate lakes have at least one, if not two, cycles of stratification and turnover every year.\nBiological Zones\nLakes contain several distinct zones of biological activity, largely determined by the availability of light and oxygen. The most important biological zones, shown in Figure 7-13, are the euphotic, littoral, and benthic zones.\nEuphotic Zone.  The upper layer of water through which sunlight can penetrate is \ncalled the euphotic zone. All plant growth occurs in this zone. In deep water, algae are the most important plants, while rooted plants grow in shallow water near the shore. The depth of the euphotic zone is determined by the amount of turbidity blocking sun-light penetration. In most lakes, the turbidity is due to algal growth, although color and suspended clays may substantially reduce sunlight penetration in some lakes. In the euphotic zone, plants produce more oxygen by photosynthesis than they remove by respiration. Below the euphotic zone lies the profundal zone.

The light compensation level cor-\nresponds roughly to a depth at which the light intensity is about 1 percent of unattenu-ated sunlight. It is important to note that the bottom of the euphotic zone only rarely coincides with the thermocline.\nLittoral Zone.  The shallow water near the shore in which rooted water plants can \ngrow is called the littoral zone. The extent of the littoral zone depends on the slope of the lake bottom and the depth of the euphotic zone. The littoral zone cannot extend deeper than the euphotic zone.\nBenthic Zone.  The bottom sediments comprise the benthic zone. As organisms \nliving in the overlying water die, they settle to the bottom where they are decom-posed by organisms living in the benthic zone. Bacteria are always present. The presence of higher life forms such as worms, insects, and crustaceans depends on the availability of oxygen.\nLake Productivity\nThe productivity of a lake is a measure of its ability to support a food web. Algae form the base of this foo"}
{"text": "d web, supplying food for the higher organisms. A lake\u2019s productiv-ity may be determined by measuring the amount of algal growth that can be supported by the available nutrients. Although a more productive lake usually will have a higher fish population, the number of the most desirable fish may decline. In fact, increased productivity generally results in reduced water quality because of undesirable changes that occur as algal growth increases. Because of the important role productivity plays in determining water quality, it forms a basis for classifying lakes. Table 7-3 shows a lake classification based on productivity.Euphotic Zone\nProfundal Zone\nLight Compensation LevelLittoral\nZoneBenthic\nZone\nFIGURE 7-13\nBiological zones in a lake.dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 428  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 428  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWATER POLLUTION   429\nOligotrophic Lakes.  Oligotrophic lakes have a low level of productivity due to a \nseverely limited supply of nutrients to support algal growth. As a result, the water is clear enough that the bottom can be seen at considerable depths. In this case, the eu-photic zone often extends into the hypolimnion, which is aerobic. Oligotrophic lakes, therefore, support cold water game fish. Lake Tahoe on the California-Nevada border is a classic example of an oligotrophic l"}
{"text": "ake.\nEutrophic Lakes.  Eutrophic lakes have a high productivity because of an abundant \nsupply of algal nutrients. The algae cause the water to be highly turbid, so the euphotic zone may extend only partially into the epilimnion. As the algae die, they settle to the lake bottom where they are decomposed by benthic organisms. In a eutrophic lake, this decomposition is sufficient to deplete the hypolimnion of oxygen during summer strat-ification. Because the hypolimnion is anaerobic during the summer, eutrophic lakes support only warm-water fish. In fact, most cold-water fish are driven out of the lake long before the hypolimnion becomes anaerobic because they generally require dis-solved oxygen levels of at least 5 mg/L. Highly eutrophic lakes may also have large mats of floating algae that typically impart unpleasant tastes and odors to the water.\nMesotrophic Lakes.  Lakes which are intermediate between oligotrophic and eutro-\nphic are called mesotrophic. Although substantial depletion of oxygen may have  occurred in the hypolimnion, it remains aerobic.\nSenescent Lakes.  These are very old, shallow lakes which have thick organic sediments \nand rooted water plants in great abundance. These lakes will eventually become marshes.\nEutrophication\nEutrophication is a natural process in which lakes gradually become shallower and more productive through the introduction and cycling of nutrients. Thus, oligotrophic lakes gradually pass through the mesotrophic, eutrophic, and senescent "}

In some lakes \nthe eutrophication process is so slow that thousands of years may pass with little change in water quality. Other lakes may have been eutrophic from the day they were formed, if nutrient levels were high at that time. Cultural eutrophication is caused when human activity speeds the processes natu-\nrally occurring by increasing the rate at which sediments and nutrients are added to the lake. Thus, lake pollution can be seen as the intensification of a natural process. This is not to say that eutr"}
{"text": "ophic lakes are necessarily polluted, but that pollution contributes to eutrophication. Water quality management in lakes is primarily concerned with slowing eutrophication to at least the natural rate. To understand the factors involved in eutrophication, it is necessary to understand the factors contributing to algal growth.\nAlgal Growth Requirements\nAll algae require macronutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and mi-cronutrients, such as trace elements. For algae to grow, all nutrients must be available. Lack of any one nutrient will limit the total algal population. The availability of each nutrient and its natural cycle are summarized below.\nCarbon.  Algae obtain their carbon from carbon dioxide dissolved in the water. Because \nthe carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with the bicarbonate buffer system (see Chapter 6), the immediately available carbon is determined by the alkalinity of the water. However, as carbon dioxide is removed from the water, it is replenished from the atmosphere. The atmosphere is, of course, a virtually inexhaustible source of this gas. When algae are either consumed by higher organisms or die and decompose, the organic carbon is oxidized back to carbon dioxide which returns either to the water or to the atmosphere to complete the carbon cycle.\nNitrogen.  Nitrogen in lakes is usually in the form of nitrate (NO\n2\n3) and comes from \nexternal sources by way of inflowing streams or groundwater. When taken up for algal \ngrowth, the nitroge"}
{"text": "n is chemically reduced to amino-nitrogen (NH2\n2) and incorporated \ninto organic compounds. When dead algae undergo decomposition, the organic nitro-\ngen is released to the water as ammonia (NH 3). The ammonia is then oxidized back to \nnitrate by bacteria in the same nitrification process discussed earlier in river systems. Nitrogen cycles from nitrate to organic nitrogen, to ammonia, and back to nitrate as long as the water remains aerobic. However, in anaerobic sediments, and in the  hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes, when algal decomposition has depleted the oxygen supply, nitrate is reduced by anaerobic bacteria to nitrogen gas (N\n2) and lost from the \nsystem in a process called denitrification. Denitrification reduces the average time ni-trogen remains in the lake system. The denitrification reaction is\n 2NO\n2\n31organ ic car bonLN21CO 21H2O (7-51)\n Some photosynthetic microorganisms can also fix nitrogen gas from the atmo-\nsphere by converting it to organic nitrogen. In lakes the most important nitrogen-fixing microorganisms are photosynthetic bacteria called cyanobacteria, formerly known as blue-green algae because of the pigments they contain. Because of their nitrogen- fixing ability, cyanobacteria have a competitive advantage over green algae when  nitrate dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 430  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 430  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/d"}

Cyanobacteria can also produce toxins which kill fish. Fortunately, these nui-sance organisms are not prevalent unless the supply of soluble fixed nitrogen is  reduced to low levels.\nPhosphorus.  Phosphorus in lakes originates from external sources and is taken up by \nalgae in the inorganic form (PO\n32\n4) and incorporated into organic compounds. During \nalgal decomposition, phosphorus is returned to the inorganic form. The release of phos-phorus from dead algal cells is so rapid that only a little of it leaves the epilimnion with the settling algal cells. However, little by little, phosphorus is transferred to the sedi-ments, some of it in undecomposed organic matter; some of it in precipitates of iron, aluminum, and calcium; and some bound to clay particles. To a large extent, the perma-nent removal of phosphorus from the overlying waters to the sediments depends on the amount of iron, aluminum, calcium, and clay entering the lake along with phosphorus.\nTrace Elements.  The quantities of trace elements required to support algal growth \nare so small that most fresh waters have sufficient amounts for a substantial algal population.\nThe Limiting Nutrient\nI"}
{"text": "n 1840, Justin Liebig formulated the idea that \u201cgrowth of a plant is dependent on the amount of foodstuff that is presented to it in minimum quantity.\u201d This is now known as Liebig\u2019s law of the minimum. As applied to algae, it means that algal growth will be limited by the nutrient that is least available. Of all the nutrients, only phosphorus is not readily available from the atmosphere or the natural water supply. For this reason, phosphorus is deemed the limiting nutrient in lakes. The amount of phosphorus con-trols the quantity of algal growth and therefore the productivity of lakes. This can be seen from Figure 7-14 in which the concentration of chlorophyll a is plotted against \nphosphorus concentration. Chlorophyll a, one of the green pigments involved in pho-\ntosynthesis, is found in all algae, so it is used to distinguish the amount of algae in the\u00a0water from other organic solids such as bacteria. It has been estimated that the phosphorus concentration should be below 0.010 to 0.015 mg/L to limit algae blooms (V ollenweider, 1975).\nControl of Phosphorus in Lakes\nBecause phosphorus is usually the limiting nutrient, control of cultural eutrophica-tion must be accomplished by reducing the input of phosphorus to the lake. Once the input is reduced, the phosphorus concentration will gradually fall as phosphorus is buried in the sediment or flushed from the lake. Other strategies for reversing or slowing the eutrophication process, such as precipitating phosphorus with addit"}

In conjunction with reduced phosphorus \ninputs, these measures can help speed up the removal of phosphorus already in the lake system. Of course, the need to speed the recovery process must be weighed against the potential damage from inundating shoreline areas with sludge and stirring up toxic compounds buried in the sediment. To be able to reduce phosphorus inputs, it is necessary to know the sources of phos-phorus and the potential for their reduction. The natural source of phosphorus is the weathering of rock. Phosphorus released from the rock can enter the water directly, but more commonly it is taken up by plants and enters the water in the form of dead plant matter. It is exceedingly difficult to reduce the natural inputs of phosphorus. If these sources are large, the lake is generally naturally eutrophic. For many lakes the principal sources of phosphorus are the result of hu"}

Municipal wastewaters also contain large quantities of phosphorus from detergents containing polyphosphate, which is a chain of phosphate ions (usually three) linked together. The polyphosphate binds with hardness in water to make the detergent a more effective cleaning agent. By the 1970s, phosphorus loading from detergents was approximately twice that from human excre-ment. Today\u2019s d"}
{"text": "etergents do not contain phosphorus because the manufacturers have replaced it with other chemicals.\nSeptic Tank Seepage.  The shores of many lakes are dotted with homes and summer \ncottages, each with its own septic tank and tile field for waste disposal. As treated waste-water moves through the soil toward the lake, phosphorus is adsorbed by soil particles, especially clay. Thus, during the early life of the tile field, very little phosphorus gets to the lake. However, with time, the capacity of the soil to adsorb phosphorus is exceeded and any additional phosphorus will pass on into the lake, contributing to eutrophication. The time it takes for phosphorus to break through to the lake depends on the type of soil, the distance to the lake, the amount of wastewater generated, and the concentration of phosphorus in that wastewater. To prevent phosphorus from reaching the lake, it is neces-sary to put the tile field far enough from the lake that the adsorption capacity of the soil is not exceeded. If this is not possible, it may be necessary to replace the septic tanks and tile fields with a sewer to collect the wastewater and transport it to a treatment facility.\nAgricultural Runoff.   Because phosphorus is a plant nutrient, it is an important in-\ngredient in fertilizers. As rain water washes off fertilized fields, some of the phospho-\nrus is carried into streams and then into lakes. Most of the phosphorus not taken up by growing plants is bound to soil particles.

Waste minimization can be applied to the control of phos-phorus loading to lakes from agricultural fertilization by encouraging farmers to fertil-ize more often with smaller amounts and to take effective action to stop soil erosion.\nAcidification of Lakes\nPure rainwater is slightly acid. As we discussed in Chapter 5, CO 2 dissolves in water \nto form carbonic acid (H 2CO 3). The equilibrium concentration of H 2CO 3 results in a \nrainwater pH of approximately 5.6. Thus, acid rain is usually defined to be precipita-tion with a pH less than 5.6. The northeastern U.S. and Canada frequently record rain-water pH values between 4 and 5 (Figure 7-15). These low pH values have been attributed to emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides from the combustion of fossil  fuels (see Chapter 9). Fish, and in particular trout and Atlantic salmon, are very sensitive to low pH lev-els. Most are severely stressed if the pH drops below 5.5, and few are able to survive if the pH falls below 5.0. If the pH falls below 4.0, cricket frogs and spring peepers ex-perience mortalities in excess of 85 percent. High aluminum concentrations are often the trigger that kills fish. Aluminum is abundant in soil but it is normally bound up in the soil minerals. At normal pH values aluminum rarely occurs in solution. Acidification of the water releases highly toxic Al\n31 to the water.dav01145_ch07_388-454.indd Page 433  13/10/11  5:51 AM user-f466dav0114"}

To the \nextent that the buffer capacity of the lake is not exceeded, the pH of the lake will not \nbe appreciably affected by acid rain. If there is a source of carbonate to replace that \nconsumed by the acid rain, the buffering capacity can be quite large. Calcareous \nsoils are those containing large quantities of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). As shown \nin Figure 6-10, carbonic acid releases bicarbonate into solution. H1 from acid rain \nwill also release bicarbonate. Thus, lakes formed in calcareous soils tend to be resis-\ntant to acidification.\n Other factors that affect the susceptibility of a lake to acidification are the permea-\nbility and depth of the soil, the bedrock, the slope and size of the watershed, and the type \nof vegetation. Thin, impermeable soils provide little time for contact between the soil \nand the precipitation. This reduces the potential for the soil to buffer the acid precipita-\ntion. Likewise, small watersheds with steep slopes reduce the time for buffering to occur. \nDeciduous foliage tends to decrease acidity. Coniferous foliage tends to yield runoff that \nis more acid than the precipitation itself. Granite bedrock offers little  potential to b"}

It is a place of transition, where freshwater mixes with saltwater. \nEstuaries are influenced by tides. The Bay of Fundy, Boston Harbor, Chesapeake Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Florida Bay, Hudson River estuary, Mobile Bay, Puget Sound, and San Francisco Bay are examples of estuaries. The mix of saltwater and freshwater combined with the diurnal cycle of tidal wetting and drying and changes in salinity make the estuary ecosystem extremely complex. Numerous different habitats support an abundance of a wide variety of different animals. Each of these is sensitive to minor changes in the quality of the water. Like other surface waters, estuaries are subject to a plethora of pollutants. Al-though the technologies and policies that serve to manage the water quality of lakes and rivers also apply to estuaries, the management of the water quality is complicated by the number of political jurisdictions that tou"}

However, once groundwater becomes contaminated, its location and low rate of replacement with freshwater makes it difficult to return it to\u00a0a pristine state. Two major source of contaminants are of concern: uncontrolled  releases of biological and chemical contaminants and saltwater intrusion from over pumping of wells.\nUncontrolled Releases\nUncontrolled releases come from a variety of sources:\n \u2022 Discharge from improperly operated or loca"}

Water-soluble chemicals are likely to move vertically down through the soil to the aquifer and migrate with the water as shown in Figure 7-17.  Nitrate, methyl tertiary butyl ketone (a gasoline additive), and methamidophos (a pes-ticide) are examples of water soluble chemicals. Chemicals that are only sparingly soluble migrate through the aquifer as a sepa-rate nonaqueous phase. These chemicals are known as nonaqueous phase liquids  \n(NAPLs). The NAPLs are divided into two categories based on their density. The light NAPLs or (LNAPLs) are less dense than water and will tend to \u201cfloat\u201d on the water table as shown in Figure 7-18. Some of the chemical will dissolve into the ground water and some of the chemical may volatilize into the pore spaces of the un-saturated zone. Examples of LNAPLs include gasoline and aviation fuel. The dense NAPLs (DNAPLs) have a density greater than that of water. They will tend to \u201csink\u201d in the aquifer until they reach an impervious barrier. The behavior of DNAPLs is shown in Figure 7-19. Trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and PCB-laden oils are examples of DNAPLs. "}

This meant the use of on-site disposal systems such as the pit privy and direct discharge into our lakes and streams. Over the last cen-tury it has been recognized that this approach produces an undesirable impact on the environment. This led to a variety of treatment techniques that characterize the  municipal treatment systems today that are the focal point of this chapter. As we look forward, it becomes obvious that in the interest of sustainability as well as fundamen-tal economic efficiency, we must view the wastewater as a raw material to be con-served. Clean water is a scarce commodity; it should be treated as such and conserved and reused. The contents of wastewater are often viewed as pollutants. The abundance of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen are, in some treatment schemes (as  discussed in Section 8-10)"}
{"text": ", recovered for crop growth. This approach must become more prevalent to achieve a sustainable future. The organic compounds in wastewater are a source of energy. Currently we utilize the processes described in Section 8-11 to  recover some of this energy. Other efforts that focus on improving the efficiency of energy utilization in wastewater treatment are discussed in Chapter 13.\nApplications\nThis chapter provides an overview of the characteristics of wastewater, treatment stan-dards, and wastewater treatment processes. Treatment standards provide the basic rules for the water quality to be produced by a treatment system. The characteristics of the wastewater identify the constituents that must be addressed by the design engineer in selecting appropriate wastewater treatment processes. This chapter will enable you to make a preliminary selection and organization of appropriate processes for treat-ment of a municipal wastewater. This chapter will provide you with tools to do the following:\n \u2022 Estimate the volume of a basin to dampen flow and BOD variations\n \u2022 Size sedimentation tanks \u2022 Estimate the size of biological treatment processes \u2022 Estimate the size of a blower for aeration of a biological treatment process \u2022 Estimate the amount of sludge generated in a biological treatment processdav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 456  10/14/11  1:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 456  10/14/11  1:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pag"}

Aged, septic sewage is considerably more offensive to the olfactory nerves. The characteristic rotten-egg odor of hydrogen sulfide and the mercaptans is indicative of septic sewage. Fresh sewage is typically gray in color. Septic sewage is black. Wastewater temperatures normally range between 10 and 20 8C. In general, the \ntemperature of the wastewater will be higher than that of the water supply. This is  because of the addition of warm water from households and heating within the plumbing system of the structure. One cubic meter of wastewater weighs approximately 1,000,000 grams. It will contain about 500 grams of solids. One-half of the solids will be dissolved solids such as calcium, sodium, and soluble organic compounds. The remaining 250 grams will be insoluble. The insoluble fraction consists of about 125 grams of material that will  settle out of the liquid fraction in 30 minutes under quiescent conditions. The remaining 125 grams will remain in \nsuspension for a very long time. The result is that wastewater is highly turbid.\nChemical Characteristics of Domestic"}
{"text": " Wastewater\nBecause the number of chemical compounds found in wastewater is almost limitless, we normally restrict our consideration to a few general classes of compounds. These classes often are better known by the name of the test used to measure them than by what is included in the class. The biochemical oxygen demand (BOD\n5) test, which we \ndiscussed in Chapter 7, is a case in point. Another closely related test is the chemical oxygen demand (COD) test. The COD test is used to determine the oxygen equivalent of the organic matter that can be oxidized by a strong chemical oxidizing agent (potassium dichromate) in an acid medium. The COD of a waste, in general, will be greater than the BOD\n5 be-\ncause more compounds can be oxidized chemically than can be oxidized biologically, and because BOD\n5 does not equal ultimate BOD.\n The COD test can be conducted in about 3 hours. If it can be correlated with BOD 5, it \ncan be used to aid in the operation and control of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) is a measure of the total organic and ammonia nitro-\ngen in the wastewater.* TKN gives a measure of the availability of nitrogen for building cells, as well as the potential nitrogenous oxygen demand that will have to be satisfied to meet discharge standards that protect receiving bodies of water. Phosphorus may appear in many forms in wastewater. Among the forms found are the orthophosphates, polyphosphates, and organic phosphate. For our purpose, w"}

The \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a definition of secondary treatment based on three wastewater characteristics: BOD\n5, suspended solids, and \nhydrogen-ion concentration (pH). The definition is summarized in Table 8-6. PL 92-500 also directed that the EPA establish a permit system called the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Under the NPDES program, all  facilities that discharge pollutants from any point source into waters of the United States are required to obtain a NPDES permit. Although some states elected to have EPA administer their permit system, most states administer their own program.

The permit may require lower concen-trations than those specified in Table 8-6 to maintain the quality of the receiving body of water. In addition, the states may impose additional conditions in the NPDES permit. For example, in Michigan, a limit of 1 mg/L of phosphorus is contained in permits for discharges to surface waters that do not have substantial problems with high levels of nutrients. More stringent limits are required for discharges to surface waters that are very sensitive to nutrients. CBOD\n5 limits are placed in the NPDES permits for all facilities that have the po-\ntential to contribute significant quantities of oxygen-consuming substances. The ni-trogenous oxygen demand from ammonia nitrogen is typically the oxygen demand of concern from municipal discharges (see Section 7-3). It is computed separately from the CBOD\n5 and then combined to establish a discharge limit. Ammonia is also evalu-\nated for its potential toxicity to the stream\u2019s biota. Bacterial effluent limits may also be included in the NPDES permit. For example, municipal wastewater treatment plants in Michigan must comply with limits of 200 fecal col"}

Michigan rules state that the Great Lakes and connecting waters and in-land lakes shall not receive a heat load that increases the temperature of the receiving water more than 1.78C above the existing natural water temperature after mixing. For rivers, streams, and impoundments the temperature limits are 18C for cold-water fish-eries and 2.88 C for warm-water fisheries. (See Section 2-4 for a discussion of energy \nbalances and Problems 2-36, 2-37, and 2-40 for typical problems in thermal discharge analysis.) An example of NPDES limits is shown in Table 8-7.* Note that in addition to concentration limits, mass discharge limits are also established.

The wastes can damage sewers and interfere with the operation of treatment plants. They may pass through the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) untreated or they may con-centrate in the sludge, rendering it a hazardous waste. The Clean Water Act gives the EPA the authority to establish and enforce pretreat-ment standards for discharge of industrial wastewaters into municipal treatment sys-tems. Specific o"}

It is commonly assumed that each of the \u201cdegrees of treatment\u201d noted"}
{"text": " in Figure 8-1 includes the previous steps. For example, primary treatment is assumed to include the pretreatment processes: bar rack, grit chamber, and equalization basin. Likewise, secondary treatment is assumed to include all the processes of primary treatment: bar rack, grit chamber, equalization basin, and primary settling tank. The purpose of pretreatment is to provide protection to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) equipment that follows. In some older municipal plants the equaliza-tion step may not be included. The major goal of primary treatment is to remove from wastewater those pollutants that will either settle or float. Primary treatment will typically remove about 60\u00a0percent of the suspended solids in raw sewage and 35 percent of the BOD\n5. Soluble pollutants \nare not removed. At one time, this was the only treatment used by many cities. Although primary treatment alone is no longer acceptable, it is still frequently used as the first treatment step in a secondary-treatment system. The major goal of secondary treatment is to remove the soluble BOD\n5 that escapes the primary process and to provide added \nremoval of suspended solids. Secondary treatment is typically achieved by using bio-logical processes. These provide the same biological reactions that would occur in the receiving water if it had adequate capacity to assimilate the wastewater. The secondary-treatment processes are designed to speed up these natural processes so that the break-down of the deg"}
{"text": "radable organic pollutants can be achieved in relatively short time periods. Although secondary treatment may remove more than 85 percent of the BOD\n5 \nand suspended solids, it does not remove significant amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, or heavy metals, nor does it completely remove pathogenic bacteria and viruses. In cases where secondary levels of treatment are not adequate, additional treatment processes are applied to the secondary effluent to provide tertiary wastewater treatment. These processes may involve chemical treatment and filtration of the wastewater.  Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) processes produce a sparkling clean, col-orless, odorless effluent indistinguishable in appearance from a high-quality drinking water. They are used to prepare tertiary treated wastewater for reuse in recharging groundwater aquifers, indirect potable reuse through surface water augmentation, and direct potable reuse (Metcalf & Eddy, 2007). The processes used are often the same as those used for treatment of drinking water. Most of the impurities removed from the wastewater do not simply vanish. Some organic compounds are broken down into harmless carbon dioxide and water.

Because most \nof the impurities removed from the wastewater are present in the sludge, sludge handling and disposal must be carried out carefully to achieve satisfactory pollution control.\n8-5 UNIT OPERATIONS OF PRETREATMENT\nSeveral devices and structures are placed upstream of the primary treatment operation to provide protection to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) equipment. These devices and structures are classified as pretreatment because they have little effect in reducing BOD\n5.

In modern WWTPs, the racks are cleaned mechanically. The solid mate-\nrial is stored in a hopper and removed to a sanitary landfill at  regular intervals.\n Bar racks (or bar screens) may be categorized as trash racks, manually cleaned \nracks, and mechanically cleaned racks. Trash racks are those with large openings, 40 \nto 150 mm, that are designed to prevent very large objects such as logs from enter-\ning\u00a0the plant. These are normally followed by racks with smaller openings. Manually \ncleaned racks have openings that range from 25 to 50 mm. Channel approach veloci-\nties are designed to be in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 m/s. As mentioned above, manually \ncleaned racks are not frequently employed. They do find application in bypass chan-\nnels that are infrequently used. Mechanically cleaned racks have openings ranging \nfrom 15 to 75 mm. Maximum channel approach velocities range from 0.6 to 1.0 m/s. \nMinimum velocities of 0.3 to 0.5 m/s are necessary to prevent grit accumulation. \n Regardless of the type of rack, two channels with racks are provided to allow one to be \ntaken out of service for cleaning and repair.\nGrit Chambers\nInert dense material, such as sand, broken glass, silt, and pebbles, is called grit.

In addition, they have a tendency to settle in \ncorners and bends, reducing flow capacity and, ultimately, clogging pipes and channels.\n There are two basic types of grit-removal devices: aerated and vortex.\nAerated Grit Chambers.  The spiral roll of the aerated grit chamber liquid \u201cdrives\u201d \nthe grit into a hopper which is located under the air diffuser assembly (Figure 8-3). The shearing action of the air bubbles is supposed to strip the inert grit of much of the organic material that adheres to its surface. Aerated grit chamber performance is a function of the roll velocity and detention time. The roll velocity is controlled by adjusting the air feed rate. Nominal air flow values are in the range of 0.1 to 0.75 cubic meters per minute of air per meter of tank length (m\n3/min ? m). Liquid detention times are usually set to be about three minutes \nat maximum flow. Length-to-width ratios range from 2.5:1 to 5:1 with depths on the order of 2 to 5 m. Grit accumulation in the chamber varies greatly, depending on whether the sewer system is a combined type or a separate type, and on the efficiency of the chamber. For combined systems, 90"}

In separate systems you might expect something less than 40 m3/106 m3. \nNormally the grit is buried in a sanitary landfill.\nVortex Grit Chambers.   Wastewater is brought into the chamber tangentially \n(Figure 8-4). At the center of the chamber, a rotating turbine with adjustable-pitch \nblades along with the cone-shaped floor produces a spiraling, doughnut-shaped flow pattern. This pattern tends to lift the lighter organic particles and settle the grit into a grit sump. The effluent outlet has twice the width of the influent flume. This results in a lower exit velocity than the influent velocity and thus prevents grit from being drawn into the effluent flow. It should be noted that centrifugal acceleration does not play a significant role in removing the particles.

These devices are \nplaced downstream of the grit chambers to protect the cutting bars from abrasion. They are used as a replacement for the downstream bar rack but must be installed with a hand-cleaned rack in parallel in case they fail. Comminutors may create a string of material such as rags that collect on downstream equipment. Because of this and a high maintenance cost, newer installations use a screen or a macerator  \n(Figure 8-5).  Macerators are slow-speed grinders. One type consists of counterrotating blades.  The material is chopped as it passes between the blades. The chopping action reduces the potential for producing ropes of rags or plastic.\nEqualization\nFlow equalization is not a treatment process in itself, but a technique that can be used to improve the effectiveness of both secondary and tertiary wastewater treat-ment processes (U.S. EPA, 1979a). Wastewater does not flow into a municipal wastewater treatment plant at a constant rate (see Figure 1-4); the flow rate varies from hour to hour, reflecting the living habits of the area served. In most towns, the pattern of daily  activities sets the pattern of sewage flow and strength. Above-average sewage flows and strength occur in midmorning.

The purpose of flow equalization is to dampen these variations so that \nthe wastewater can be treated at a nearly constant flow rate. Flow equalization can \nsignificantly improve the performance of an existing plant and increase its useful \ncapacity. In new plants, flow equalization can reduce the size and cost of the \n treatment units.\n Flow equalization is usually achieved by constructing large basins that collect and \nstore the wastewater flow and from which the wastewater is pumped to the treatment \nplant at a constant rate. These basins are normally located near the head end of the \ntreatment works, preferably downstream of pretreatment facilities such as bar screens, \ncomminutors, and grit chambers.

Theoretically, if the final S dS at the end of a cycle is positive, the equalization basin \nwill fill up. Likewise, a negative value for S dS implies that there is no wastewater \nto pump to downstream processes. In reality, it is unlikely that the inflow will be perfectly sinusoidal. In addition, the provision of 25 percent extra volume and the ability to increase the pumping rate compensate for these eventualities.\n8-6 PRIMARY TREATMENT\nWith the screening completed and the grit removed, the wastewater still contains light organic suspended solids, some of which can be removed from the sewage by gravity in a sedimentation tank. These tanks can be round or rectangular. The mass of settled solids is called raw sludge. The sludge is removed from the sedimentation \ntank by mechanical scrapers and pumps (Figure 8-6). Floating materials, such as grease and oil, rise to the surface of the sedimentation tank, where they are  collected by a surface skimming system and removed from the tank for further  processing.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 473  13/1"}

The Stokes equation cannot be used because the flocculating particles are continually changing in size, shape, and, when water is entrapped in the floc, spe-cific gravity. There is no adequate mathematical relationship that can be used to de-scribe Type II settling. Laboratory tests with settling columns are used to develop design data (see Chapter 6). Rectangular tanks with common-wall construction are frequently chosen because they are advantageous for sites with space constraints. Typically, these tanks range from 30 to 100 m in length and 3 to 24 m in width. Common length-to-width ratios for the design of new facilities range from 3:1 to 5:1. Existing plants have length-to-width ratios ranging from 1.5:1 to 15:1. The width is often controlled by the availability of sludge collection equipment. Side water depths range from 3 to 5 m. Typically the depth is about 4 m. Circular tanks have diameters from 3 to 100 m. Side water depths range from 3 to 5 m. As in water treatment clarifier design, overflow rate is the controlling parame-ter for the design of primary settling tanks. At average flow, overflow rates typi -c"}
{"text": "ally range from 30 to 50 m\n3/m2 ? d (or 30 to 50 m/d). When waste-activated sludge \nis returned to the primary tank, a lower range of overflow rates is chosen (25 to 35\u00a0m/d). Under peak flow conditions, overflow rates may be in the range of 60 to 120 m/d. Hydraulic detention time in the sedimentation basin ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 hours under average flow conditions. A 2.0-hour detention time is typical. The Great Lakes\u2013Upper Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers  (GLUMRB) recommends that weir loading (hydraulic flow over the effluent weir) rates not exceed 250 m\n3/d of flow per m of weir length (m3/d ? m) for plants with aver-\nage flows less than 0.04 m3/s.

The basic ingre-dients needed for conventional aerobic secondary biologic treatment are the availabil-ity of many microorganisms, good contact between these organisms and the organic material, the availability of oxygen, and the maintenance of other favorable environ-mental conditions (for example, favorable temperature and sufficient time for the  organisms to work). A variety of approaches have been used in the past to meet these basic needs. The most common approaches are (1) activated sludge, (2) trickling filters, and (3) oxidation ponds (or lagoons). A process that does not fit precisely into either the trickling filter or the activated sludge category but does employ principles common to both is the rotating biological contactor (RBC). Because the secondary treatment processes are fundamentally microbiological, we begin this discussion with an introduction to wastewater microbiology.\nWastewater Microbiology\nRole of Microorganisms.   The stabilization of organic matter is accomplished bio-\nlogically"}
{"text": " using a variety of microorganisms. The microorganisms convert the colloidal and dissolved carbonaceous organic matter into various gases and into protoplasm. Because protoplasm has a specific gravity slightly greater than that of water, it can be removed from the treated liquid by gravity settling. It is important to note that unless the protoplasm produced from the organic matter is removed from the solution, complete treatment will not be accomplished because the protoplasm, which itself is organic, will be measured as BOD in the effluent. If the protoplasm is not removed, the only treatment that will be achieved is that associated with the bacterial conversion of a portion of the organic matter originally present to various gaseous end products (Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 1979.)\nClassification of Microorganisms by Kingdoms.  Microorganisms are organized into \nfive broad groups based on their structural and functional differences. The groups are called kingdoms. The five kingdoms are animals, plants, protista, fungi, and  bacteria.  \nRepresentative examples and characteristics of differentiation are shown in Figure 8-7.\nClassification by Energy and Carbon Source. The relationship between the source \nof carbon and the source of energy for the microorganism is important. Carbon is the basic building block for cell synthesis. A source of energy must be obtained from out-side the cell to enable synthesis to proceed. Our goal in wastewater treatment is to con-vert both the carbon an"}
{"text": "d the energy in the wastewater into the cells of microorganisms, which we can remove from the water by settling. Therefore, we wish to encourage the growth of organisms that use organic material for both their carbon and energy source. If the microorganism uses organic material as a supply of carbon, it is called  heterotrophic. Autotrophs require only CO\n2 to supply their carbon needs.\n Organisms that rely only on the sun for energy are called phototrophs. Chemot-\nrophs extract energy from organic or inorganic oxidation/reduction reactions. dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 476  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 476  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWASTEWATER TREATMENT   477\n Organotrophs use organic materials, while lithotrophs oxidize inorganic compounds \n(Bailey and Ollis, 1977).\nClassification by their Relationship to Oxygen.   Bacteria also are classified by \ntheir ability or inability to utilize oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor* in oxidation/\nreduction reactions.

Thus, biological oxidation occurs in small steps. Oxidation requires the transfer of an electron from the substance being oxidized to some acceptor molecule that will subsequently be reduced. In most biological systems, each step in the oxidation process involves the re-moval of two electrons and the simultaneous loss of two protons (H\n1). The combination of the two losses is \nequivalent to the molecule having lost two hydrogen atoms. The reaction is often referred to as dehydrogenation. \nThe electrons and protons are not released into the cell, but are transferred to an acceptor molecule.

They cannot use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. Wastewater that is \ndevoid of oxygen is called anaerobic. Facultative anaerobes  can use oxygen as the \nterminal electron acceptor and, under certain conditions, they can also grow in the absence of oxygen. Under anoxic conditions, a group of facultative anaerobes called denitrifiers  uti-\nlizes nitrites (NO\n22) and nitrates (NO 32) as the terminal electron acceptor. Nitrate nitro-\ngen is converted to nitrogen gas in the absence of oxygen. This process is called anoxic \ndenitrification.\nClassification by their Preferred Temperature Regime.  Each species of bacteria \nreproduces best within a limited range of temperatures. Four temperature ranges are used to classify bacteria. Those that grow best at temperatures below 20 8C are called \npsychrophiles. Mesophiles grow best at temperatures between 25 and 408 C. Between \n45 and 608 C, the thermophiles grow best. A"}

These ranges are qualitative and somewhat subjective. You will note the gaps between 20 and 258C and between 40 and 458C. Don\u2019t make the mistake of saying that an organism that grows well at 20.5 8C is a mesophile. The rules just \naren\u2019t that hard and fast. Bacteria will grow over a range of temperatures and will sur-vive at a very large range of temperatures. For example, Escherichia coli, classified as mesophiles, will grow at temperatures between 20 and 508C and will reproduce, albeit very slowly, at temperatures down to 0 8C. If frozen rapidly, they and many other mi-\ncroorganisms can be stored for years with no significant death rate.\nBacteria.

If the daylight hours exceed the night hours by a reasonable amount, there is a net production of oxygen.\nProtozoa.  Protozoa are single-celled organisms that can reproduce by binary fission \n(dividing in two). Most are aerobic chemoheterotrophs, and they often consume bacte-ria.

Their pres-ence is indicative of a high level of dissolved oxygen and a very low level of organic matter.\nBacterial Biochemistry\nThe general term that describes all of the chemical activities performed by a cell is metabolism. This in turn is divided into two parts: catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism  \nincludes all the biochemical processes by which a substrate is degraded to end products with the release of energy.* In wastewater treatment, the substrate is oxidized. The oxidation process releases energy that is transferred to an energy carrier, which stores it for future use by the bacterium (Figure 8-8). Some chemical compounds released by catabolism are used by the bacterial cell for its life functions. Anabolism includes all the biochemical processes by which the bacterium synthe-\nsizes new chemical compounds needed by the cells to live and reproduce. The synthe-sis process is driven by the energy that was stored in the energy carrier.\nDecomposition of Waste.   The type of electron acceptor available for catabolism \ndetermines the type of decomposition (that is, aerobic, anoxic, or anaerobic) used by a \nmixed culture of microorganisms. Each type of decomposition has peculiar character-istics that affect its use in waste treatment.\nAerobic Decomposition.

When oxygen is present, it is the only terminal electron acceptor used. Hence, the chemical end products of decomposition are primarily carbon di-oxide, water, and new cell material (Table 8-8). Odiferous gaseous end products are kept to a minimum. In healthy natural water systems, aerobic decomposition is the principal means of self-purification.\n*Substrate is food.

This fact, coupled with the fact that the final end products are oxidized to a very low energy level, results in a more stable end product (that is, one that can be disposed of without damage to the environment and without creating a nuisance condition) than can be achieved by the other oxidatio"}
{"text": "n systems. Because of the large amount of energy released in aerobic oxidation, most aerobic organisms are capable of high growth rates. Consequently, there is a relatively large production of new cells in comparison with the other oxidation systems. This means that more biological sludge is generated in aerobic oxidation than in the other oxida-tion systems. Aerobic decomposition is the method of choice for large quantities of dilute wastewater (BOD\n5 less than 500 mg/L) because decomposition is rapid, efficient, and \nhas a low odor potential. For high-strength wastewater (BOD 5 is greater than 1,000 \nmg/L), aerobic decomposition is not suitable because of the difficulty in supplying enough oxygen and because of the large amount of biological sludge produced. In small communities and in special industrial applications where aerated lagoons (see \u201cOxidation Ponds,\u201d below) are used, wastewaters with BOD\n5 up to 3,000 mg/L may be \ntreated satisfactorily by aerobic decomposition.\nAnoxic Decomposition.   Some microorganisms can use nitrate (NO 32) as the termi-\nnal electron acceptor in the absence of molecular oxygen. Oxidation by this route is \ncalled denitrification.TABLE 8-8\nRepresentative end products\n Aerobic and anoxic Anaerobic\nSubstrates decomposition decompositionProteins and other Amino acids Amino acids\nnitrogen-containing Ammonia \u2192 nitrites Ammonia\ncompounds \u2192 nitrates* Hydrogen sulfide\n  Methane \n  Carbon dioxide\n  Alcohols   Organic acids\nCarbohydrates Alcohols \u2192 CO\n"}

The amount of energy made available to the cell during denitri-fication is about the same as that made available during aerobic decomposition. As a\u00a0consequence, the rate of production of new cells, although not as high as in aerobic decomposition, is relatively high. Denitrification is of importance in wastewater treatment where nitrogen must be removed to protect the receiving body. In this case, a special treatment step is added to the conventional process for removal of carbonaceous material. Denitrification will be discussed in detail later. One other important aspect of denitrification is in relation to final clarification of the treated wastewater. If the environment of the final clarifier becomes anoxic, the formation of nitrogen gas will c"}

Thus, it is necessary to ensure that anoxic conditions do not develop in the final clarifier.\nAnaerobic Decomposition.   In order to achieve anaerobic decomposition, molecular \noxygen and nitrate must not be present as terminal electron acceptors. Sulfate (SO\n422), \ncarbon dioxide, and organic compounds that can be reduced serve as terminal electron \nacceptors. The reduction of sulfate results in the production of hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) \nand a group of equally odiferous organic sulfur compounds called mercaptans.\n The anaerobic decomposition (fermentation) of organic matter generally is consid-ered to be a three-step process. In the first step, waste components are hydrolysed. In the second step, complex organic compounds are fermented to low-molecular-weight fatty acids (volatile acids). In the third step, the organic acids are converted to methane. Car-bon dioxide serves as the electron acceptor. Anaerobic decomposition yields carbon dioxide, methane, and water as the major end products. Additional end products include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and mer-captans. As a consequence of these last three compounds, anaerobic decomposition is characterized by an unbelievably horrid stench! Because only small amounts of energy are released during anaerobic oxidation, the amount of cell production is low. Thus, sludge production is low. We make use of this fact in wastew"}

Direct anaerobic decomposition of wastewater generally is not feasible for  dilute waste.* The  optimum growth temperature for the anaerobic bacteria is at the \nupper end of the mesophilic range.

For concentrated wastes (BOD\n5 greater than 1,000 mg/L), anaerobic digestion is quite \nappropriate.\nPopulation Dynamics.

Initially nothing appears to happen. The bacteria must adjust to their new environment and begin to synthesize new protoplasm. On a plot of bacterial growth versus time (Figure 8-9), this phase of growth is called the lag phase.\nDeath \nphaseStationary phase\nTime, h5       10     15       20      25      30     35      40      45      50     55       60Accelerated\ngrowth phaseBacterial numbers\nLag\nphaseLog growth phase\n103104106\n105\nFIGURE 8-9\nBacterial growth in a pure cul-\nture: the \u201clog-growth curve.\u201ddav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 482  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 482  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWASTEWATER TREATMENT   483\n At the end of the lag phase the bacteria begin to divide. Because all of the organ-\nisms do not divide at the same time, there is a gradual increase in population. This phase is labeled accelerated growth on the growth plot.

The population of bacteria ( P) after the nth \ngeneration is given by the following expression:\n P5P\n0(2)n  (8-1)\nwhere P0 is the initial population at the end of the accelerated growth phase. If we take \nthe log of both sides of Equation 8-1, we obtain the following: log P5log P\n01n log 2  (8-2)\nThis means that if we plot bacterial population on a logarithmic scale, this phase of \ngrowth would plot as a straight line of slope n and intercept P 0 at t 0 equal to the end of \nthe accelerated growth phase. Thus, this phase of growth is called the log growth or \nexponential growth phase. The log growth phase tapers off as the substrate becomes exhausted or as toxic by-products build up. Thus, at some point the population becomes constant either as a result of cessation of fission or a balance in death and reproduction rates. This is depicted by the stationary phase on the growth curve. Following the stationary phase, the bacteria begin to die faster than they repro-duce. This death phase is due to a variety of causes that are basically an extension of those that lead to the stationary phase.

It is expressed quantitatively in terms of relative mass of microorganisms.* The prime factor governing the dynamics of the various microbial populations is the competition for food. The second most important factor is the predator-prey relationship. The relative success of a pair of species competing for the same substrate is a function of the ability of the species to metabolize the substrate. The more successful species will be the one that metabolizes the substrate more completely. In so doing, it will obtain more energy for synthesis and consequently will achieve a greater mass. Because of their relatively smaller size and, thus, larger surface area per unit mass, which allows a more rapid uptake of substrate, bacteria will predominate over fungi. For the same reason, the fungi predominate over the protozoa.\n*If each individual organism of species A has, on the average, twice the mass at maturity as each individual or-\nganism of species B, and both compete equally, we would expect that both would have the same total biomass, but that there would be twice as many of species B as there would be of A.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 483  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 483  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/20"}

In a closed system with an initial inoculum of mixed microorganisms and substrate, the pop-ulations will cycle as the bacteria give way to higher level organisms which in turn die for lack of food and are then decomposed by a different set of bacteria (Figure 8-10). In an open system, such as a wastewater treatment plant or a river, with a continuous in-flow of new substrate, the predominant populations will change through the length of the plant (Figure 8-11). This condition is known as dynamic equilibrium. It is a highly sensitive state, and changes in influent characteristics must be regulated closely to maintain the proper balance of the various populations. For the large numbers and mixed cultures of microorganisms found in waste treat-ment systems, it is convenient to measure biomass rather than numbers of organisms.* In the log-growth phase, the rate expression for biomass increase is\n \ndX\ndt5mX (8-3)\nwhere dX\ndt 5 growth rate of the biomass, mg/L ? t\n m5growth rate constant, t21\n X  5 concentration of biomass, mg/L\nFIGURE 8-10\nPopulation dynamics in a closed system.

During the aeration period, adsorption, flocculation, and oxidation of organic matter occur. Activated sludge solids are separated in a secondary settling tank.\nComplete-mix  Process is an application of the flow regime of a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor. Settled wastewate"}
{"text": "r and recycled activated sludge are introduced typi-cally at several points in the aeration tank. The organic load on the aeration tank and the oxygen demand are uniform throughout the tank length.\nTapered aeration  Tapered aeration is a modification of the conventional plug-flow process. Varying aeration rates are applied over the tank length depending on the oxygen demand. Greater amounts of air are supplied to the head end of the aeration tank, and the amounts diminish as the mixed liquor approaches the effluent end. Tapered aeration is usually achieved by using different spacing of the air diffusers over the tank length.\nStep-feed aeration  Step feed is a modification of the conventional plug-flow process in which the settled wastewater is introduced at several points in the aeration tank to equalize the food-to-microorganism (F/M) ratio, thus lowering peak oxygen demand. Generally three or more parallel channels are used. Flexibility of operation is one of the important features of this process.\nModified aeration  Modified aeration is similar to the conventional plug-flow process except that shorter aeration times and higher F/M ratios are used. BOD removal efficiency is lower than other activated sludge processes.\nContact stabilization  Contact stabilization uses two separate tanks or compartments for the \ntreatment of the wastewater and stabilization of the activated sludge. The stabilized activated sludge is mixed with the influent (either raw or settled) wastewater i"}

Process is used extensively for prefabricated package plants for small communities.\nHigh-rate aeration  High-rate aeration is a process modification in which high MLSS concen-\ntrations are combined with high volumetric loadings. This combination allows high F/M ratios and long mean cell-residence times with relatively short hydraulic detention times. Adequate mixing is very important.\nKraus process  Kraus process is a variation of the step aeration process used to treat \nwastewater with low nitrogen levels. Digester supernatant is added as a nutrient source to a portion of the return sludge in a separate aeration tank designed to nitrify. The resulting mixed liquor is then "}
{"text": "added to the main plug-flow aeration system.\nHigh-purity oxygen  High-purity oxygen is used instead of air in the activated sludge process. Oxygen is diffused into covered aeration tanks and is recirculated. A portion of the gas is wasted to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide. pH adjustment may also be required. The amount of oxygen added is about four times greater than the amount that can be added by conventional aeration systems.\nOxidation ditch   The oxidation ditch consists of a ring- or oval-shaped channel and is equipped \nwith mechanical aeration devices. Screened wastewater enters the ditch, is aerated, and circulates at about 0.25 to 0.35 m/s. Oxidation ditches typically operate in an extended aeration mode with long detention and solids retention times. Secondary sedimentation tanks are used for most applications.\nSequencing batch reactor  The sequencing batch reactor is a fill-and-draw type reactor system \ninvolving a single complete-mix reactor in which all steps of the activated sludge process occur. Mixed liquor remains in the reactor during all cycles, thereby eliminating the need for separate secondary sedimentation tanks.\nDeep-shaft reactor  The deep vertical-shaft reactor is a form of the activated sludge process. \nA vertical shaft about 120 to 150 m deep replaces the primary clarifiers and aeration basin. The shaft is lined with a steel shell and fitted with a concentric pipe to form an annular reactor. Mixed liquor and air are forced down the cente"}
{"text": "r of the shaft and allowed to rise upward through the annulus.\nSingle-stage nitrification  In single-stage nitrification, both BOD and ammonia reduction occur in a \nsingle biological stage. Reactor configurations can be either a series of complete-mix reactors or plug flow.\nSeparate stage nitrification  In separate stage nitrification, a separate reactor is used for nitrification, \noperating on a feed waste from a preceding biological treatment unit. The advantage of this system is that operation can be optimized to conform to the nitrification needs.\naSource: Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 1991.TABLE 8-9 \n(continued )\nProcess orprocess modification Description dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 490  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 490  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWASTEWATER TREATMENT   491\nCompletely Mixed Activated Sludge Process.

The result is that efficiency of treatment is \npoor. A low rate of wasting causes a low F/M ratio, which yields organisms that are starved. This results in more complete degradation of the waste. A long u\nc (low F/M) is not always used, however, because of certain trade-offs that \nmust be considered. A long uc means a larger and more costly aeration tank.

Problems with poor sludge \u201csettleability\u201d in the final clarifier may be encountered if u\nc is too long. \nHowever, because the waste is more completely degraded to final end products and less of the waste is converted into microbial cells when the microorganisms are starved at a low F/M, there is less sludge to handle.

Among the major decisions in developing a suspended growth reactor \ndesign is the selection of the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) concentra-tion and the corresponding mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration. This selection is not simple. It depends on the objective of the reactor, settling characteristics of the sludge, and the rate of recycle of sludge (called the sludge return rate or sludge \nreturn, or return activated sludge (RAS). A high MLVSS concentration is desirable because it leads to a smaller reactor and lower construction costs. But this may lead to a larger settling tank to handle the sludge load. In addition, a higher MLVSS also requires a higher aeration rate to meet the in-crease in oxygen demand. Increasing MLVSS also requires increasing the rate at which sludge is returned from the settling tank. Finally, a higher MLVSS may lead to a higher effluent suspended solids and BOD in the effluent.

{"text": "eability. A one-liter sample of mixed liquor is obtained from the aeration tank at the discharge end. The sludge settleability is measured by filling a standard one-liter graduated  cylinder to the 1.0 liter mark, allowing undisturbed settling for 30 minutes, and then reading the volume occupied by the settled sludge. The MLSS is determined by filter-ing, drying, and weighing a second portion of the mixed liquor. SVI is defined as the volume in milliliters occupied by 1 g of activated sludge after the aerated liquor has settled 30 min. It is calculated as:\n SVI 5(Settled volume of sludge, mL/L)(10\n3 mg/g)\nMLSS, mg/L5mL\ng  (8-33)\n An SVI of 100 mL/g or less is considered a good settling sludge.

The preferred tech-\nnique is to use a vessel that is larger than a 1- or 2-liter cylinder. The vessel is equipped with a slow-speed stirring device.

It assumes that the underflow concentration from the  secondary settling tank is fixed by the concentration of the sludge and is totally  independent of the design of the final settling tank or the manner in which it is oper-ated (Dick, 1976). The use of an assumed SVI for design is not recommended. It rationalizes a bold assumption. It is more realistic to make an assumption about the MLSS con-centration within typical design ranges, provide a rigorous secondary clarifier  design, and provide sufficient flexibility in the operation of the system to achieve good settling. Nonetheless, the SVI may be the best available method for operators to evaluate performance of their clarifiers because its conservative characteristics compensate for unknowns in the behavior of the sedimentation basin (Dick, 1976). The test is empirical. Because of this the results may lead to significant errors in interpretation. This is illustrated in Example 8-8.\nExample 8-8.

Experienced operators can use the SVI results to monitor the settling process. The \nemphasis is on experience.\n3.  The preferred method for assessing secondary settling tank operating conditions is \ncalled state point analysis. A discussion of this technique may be found in Water and Wastewater Engineering (Davis, 2010).\nSludge Production.  The activated sludge process removes substrate, which exerts an oxygen demand by converting the food into new cell material and degrading this cell material while generating energy. This cell material ultimately becomes sludge that must be disposed of. Despite the problems in doing so, researchers have attempted to develop enough basic information on sludge production to permit a reliable design basis. Heukelekian and Sawyer both reported that a net yield of 0.5 kg MLVSS/kg BOD\n5 removed could be expected for a completely soluble organic substrate (Heu-\nkelekian et al., 1951, and Sawyer, 19"}
{"text": "56). Most researchers agree that, depending on the inert solids in the system and the SRT, 0.40 to 0.60 kg MLVSS/kg BOD\n5 removed \nwill normally be observed.

It is generally assumed that VSS is 60 to 80 percent of MLVSS. Thus, the increase in MLSS in Equation 8-37 may be estimated by dividing P\nx by a factor of \n0.6 to 0.8 (or multiplying by 1.25 to 1.667). The mass of suspended solids lost in the effluent is the product of the flow rate (Q  2 Q\nw) and the suspended solids \n concentration (X e).\nExample 8-9.

Oxygen is used in those reactions required to degrade the sub-\nstrate to produce the high-energy compounds required for cell synthesis and for respi-ration. For long SRT systems, the oxygen needed for cell maintenance can be of the same  order of magnitude as substrate metabolism. A minimum residual of 0.5 to 2 mg/L DO is usually maintained in the reactor basin to prevent oxygen deficiencies from limiting the rate of substrate removal.

Also, it is highly desirable that sludge recycle be well  thickened. Secondary settling tanks for activated sludge are generally characterized as having Type III settling. Some authors would argue that Types I and II also occur.

An overflow rate between 16 and 30 m/d for the average flow in a conventional process can be expected to result in good separation of liquid and SS. The design engi-neer also must check the peak hydraulic rates that will be imposed on the settling basin. Suggested secondary settling tank side water depths (SWD) are shown the Table 8-11. Solids loading rates should be in the range 100 to 150 kg MLSS/d ? m\n2.\n GLUMRB (2004) specifies that plants with a capacity less than 3,800 m3/d should \nnot have a hydraulic loading greater than 250 m3/d ? m of weir length at peak hourly \nflow. For plants larger than 3,800 m3/d, the weir loading rate is specified as less than \n350 m3/d ? m.\n Current design consensus is that weir placement and settling tank configuration have more effect on clarifier performance than the hydraulic loading.

A bulking sludge is one that has poor settling characteristics and \npoor compactability. There are two principal types of sludge bulking. The first is caused \nby the growth of filamentous organisms, and the second is caused by water trapped in the bacterial floc, thus reducing the density of the agglomerate and resulting in poor  settling. Filamentous bacteria have been blamed for much of the bulking problem in  activated sludge. Although filamentous organisms are effective in removing organic matter, they have poor floc-forming and settling characteristics. Bulking may also be caused by a number of other factors, including long, slow-moving collection-system transport; low available ammonia nitrogen when the organic load is high; low pH, which could favor acid-favoring fungi; and the lack of macronutrients, which stimu-lates predomination of the filamentous actinomycetes over the normal floc-forming bacteria. The lack of nitrogen also favors slime-producing bacteria, which have a low specific gravity, even though they are not filamentous."}
{"text": " The multicellular fungi cannot compete with the bacteria normally, but can compete under specific environmental conditions, such as low pH, low nitrogen, low oxygen, and high carbohydrates. As the pH decreases below 6.0, the fungi are less affected than the bacteria and tend to  predominate. As the nitrogen concentrations drop below a BOD\n5 : N ratio of 20:1, the \nfungi, which have a lower protein level than the bacteria, are able to produce normal protoplasm, while the bacteria produce nitrogen-deficient protoplasm. A sludge that floats to the surface after apparently good settling is called a rising sludge. Rising sludge results from denitrification, that is, reduction of nitrates and  nitrites to nitrogen gas in the sludge blanket (layer). Much of this gas remains trapped in the sludge blanket, causing globs of sludge to rise to the surface and float over the weirs into the receiving stream. Rising-sludge problems can be overcome by increasing the rate of return sludge flow (Q\nr), by increasing the speed of the sludge-collecting mechanism, by decreasing \nthe mean cell residence time, and, if possible, by decreasing the flow from the aeration tank to the offending tank.\nTrickling Filters\nA typical process flow diagram for a trickling filter plant is shown in Figure 8-20. The trickling filter itself consists of a bed of coarse material, such as stones, slats, or plastic  materials (media), over which wastewater is applied. Because the microorgan-isms that biodegrade the was"}
{"text": "te form a film on the media, this process is known as an attached growth process. Trickling filters have been a popular biologic treatment  process. The most widely used design for many years was simply a bed of stones from 1 to 3 m deep through which the wastewater passed. The wastewater is typically dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 510  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 510  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWASTEWATER TREATMENT   511\n distributed over the surface of the rocks by a rotating arm (Figure 8-21). Rock filter \n diameters may range up to 60 m. As the wastewater trickles through the bed, a microbial growth establishes itself on the surface of the stone or packing in a fixed film. The wastewater passes over the stationary microbial population, providing contact between the microorganisms and the organic contaminants. Trickling filters are not primarily a filtering or straining process as the name im-plies. The rocks in a rock filter are 25 to 100 mm in diameter and hence have openings too large to strain out solids. They are a means of providing large amounts of surface area where the microorganisms cling and grow in a slime on the rocks as they feed on the organic matter. Excess growths of microorganisms wash from the rock media and would cause undesirably high levels of suspended solids in the plant effluent if no"}
{"text": "t removed. Thus, the flow from the filter is passed through a sedimentation basin to allow these solids to settle out. As in the case of the activated sludge process this sedimentation basin is referred to as a secondary clarifier, or final clarifier. Although rock trickling filters have performed well for years, they have certain limitations. Under high organic loadings, the slime growths can be so prolific that they plug the void spaces between the rocks, causing flooding and failure of the system. Also, the volume of void spaces is limited in a rock filter, which restricts the circula-tion of air and the amount of oxygen available for the microbes. This limitation, in turn, restricts the amount of wastewater that can be processed. Other problems include odors and filter flies.\nFIGURE 8-20\nTrickling-filter plant with enlargement of trickling filter.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 511  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 511  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles(a)\nFIGURE 8-21\nTrickling filters, rock media (a) and synthetic media (b).

These materials include modules of corrugated plastic sheets and plas-tic rings. These media offer larger surface areas for slime growths (typically 90 square meters of surface area per cubic meter of bulk volume, as compared to 40 to 60 square meters per cubic meter for 75 mm rocks) and greatly increase void ratios for increased air flow. The materials are also much lighter than rock (by a factor of about 30), so that the trickling filters can be much taller without facing structural problems. While rock in filters is  usually not more than 3 m deep, synthetic media depths may reach 12 m, thus reducing the overall space requirements for the trickling-filter portion of the  treatment plant. Trickling filters are classified according to the applied hydraulic and organic load. The hydraulic load may be expressed as cubic meters of wastewater applied per day per square meter of bulk filter surface area (m\n3/d ? m3) or, preferably, as the depth of \nwater applied per unit of time (mm/s or m/d). Organic loading is expressed as  kilograms of BOD\n5 per day per cubic meter of bulk filter volume (kg/d ? m3). Common \nhydraulic and organic loadings for the the various filter classifications are summarized in Table 8-12. An important element in trickling filter design is the provision for return of a  por"}

Recirculation is practiced for plastic media to provide the desired wetting rate to keep the microorganisms alive. Generally, increasing the hydraulic loading above the minimum wetting rate does not increase BOD\n5 removal. The minimum wetting rate \nnormally falls in the range of 25 to 60 m/d. Two-stage trickling filters (Figure 8-22) provide a means of improving the perfor-mance of filters. The second stage acts as a polishing step for the effluent from the  primary stage by providing additional contact time between the waste and the micro-organisms. Both stages may use the same media or each stage may have different  media as shown in Figure 8-22.

During the daylight hours, large amounts of oxygen are supplied by the photosynthe-sis process; during the hours of darkness, wind mixing of the shallow water mass generally provides a high degree of surface reaeration. Stabilization of the organic material entering an aerobic pond is accomplished mainly through the action of aero-bic bacteria.\nAnaerobic Ponds.  The magnitude of the organic loading and the availability of dis-\nsolved oxygen determine whether the biological activity in a treatment pond will oc-\ncur under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. A pond may be maintained in an anaerobic condition by applying a BOD\n5 load that exceeds oxygen production from photosyn-\nthesis. Photosynthesis can be reduced by decreasing the surface area and increasing the depth. Anaerobic ponds become turbid from the presence of reduced metal sul-fides. This restricts light penetration to the point that algal growth becomes neg"}
{"text": "ligi-ble. Anaerobic treatment of complex wastes involves three stages. In the first stage organic matter is hydrolyzed. In the second stage (known as acid fermentation), com-plex organic materials are broken down mainly to short-chain acids and alcohols. In the third stage (known as methane  fermentation), these materials are converted to gases, primarily methane and carbon dioxide. The proper design of anaerobic ponds must result in environmental conditions favorable to methane fermentation. Anaerobic ponds are used primarily as a pretreatment process and are particularly suited for the treatment of high-temperature, high-strength wastewaters. However, they have been used successfully to treat municipal wastewaters as well.\nFacultative Ponds.   Of the five general classes of lagoons and ponds, facultative \nponds are by far the most common type selected as wastewater treatment systems for \nsmall communities. Approximately 25 percent of the municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States are ponds and about 90 percent of these ponds are located in communities of 5,000 people or fewer. Facultative ponds are popular for such treat-ment situations because long retention times facilitate the management of large fluc-tuations in wastewater flow and strength with no significant effect on effluent quality. Also capital, operating, and maintenance costs are less than those of other biological systems that provide equivalent treatment.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 518  13/"}

Suspended solids contained in the wastewater settle to the pond bottom, where an anaerobic layer develops. Microorgan-isms occupying this region do not require molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor in energy metabolism, but rather use some other chemical species. Both acid fermenta-tion and methane fermentation occur in the bottom sludge deposits. The facultative zone exists just above the anaerobic zone. This means that molecu-lar oxygen will not be available in the region at all times. Generally, the zone is aerobic during the daylight hours and anaerobic during the hours of darkness. Above the facultative zone, there exists an aerobic zone that has molecular oxygen present at all times. The oxygen is supplied from two sources. A limited amount is  supplied from diffusion across the pond surface. However, the majority is supplied through the action of algal photosynthesis. Two rules of thumb commonly used in Michigan in evaluating the design of facul-tative lagoons are as follows:\n 1. The BOD\n5 loading rate should not exceed 22 kg/ha ? d on the smallest  lagoon \ncell.\n 2. The detention time in"}
{"text": " the lagoon (considering the total volume of all cells but \nexcluding the bottom 0.6 m in the volume calculation) should be six months.\n The first criterion is to prevent the pond from becoming anaerobic.

For \nlarge lagoons, this is probably acceptable. In small lagoons, the slope should be  considered.\nRotating Biological Contactors (RBCs)\nThe RBC process consists of a series of closely spaced discs (3 to 3.5 m in diameter) mounted on a horizontal shaft and rotated, while about one-half of their surface area is immersed in wastewater (Figure 8-24). The discs are typically constructed of light-weight plastic. The speed of rotation of the discs is adjustable. When the process is placed in operation, the microbes in the wastewater begin to adhere to the rotating surfaces and grow there until the entire surface area of the discs is covered with a 1- to 3-mm layer of biological slime. As the discs rotate, they carry a film of wastewater into the air; this wastewater trickles down the surface of the discs, absorbing oxygen. As the discs complete their rotation, the film of water mixes with the reservoir of wastewater, adding to the oxygen in the reservoir "}

The process can achieve secondary effluent quality or better. By placing several sets of discs in series, it is possible to achieve even higher degrees of treatment, including biological conver-sion of ammonia to nitrates.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 521  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 521  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles522  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The history of RBC installations has not been exemplary. Poor mechanical design \nand lack of understanding of the biological process has resulted in structural failure of shafts and disks. Many of the problems with early installations have been resolved and numerous installations are performing satisfactorily. The principal advantages of the RBC process are simplicity of operation and rela-tively low energy costs. They have found application in small communities.\nIntegrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge (IFAS)\nThis category includes any activated sludge system that incorporates a fixed-film media in a suspended growth reactor. The purpose of fixed-film media is to increase the biomass in the reactor. This offers the potential to reduce the basin size or to increase the capacity of an existing"}
{"text": " basin in a retrofit application. Various types of suspended growth systems have been used. Examples include conventional, modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE), and step denitrification. These processes differ from the MBBR  described below in that they use a return sludge flow. A number of proprietary media types have been used including rope (no longer in use), sponge, plastic carriers, and a honeycomb polyester fabric called BioWeb\u2122. The media that are fixed in a frame are preferred because they require fewer appurtenances and are less susceptible to hydraulic problems that result from free-floating media. The media frames are placed in conventional aeration tanks above a grid of fine bubble diffusers. The frames vary in size to fit the aeration tank dimensions. For  example, an arrangement of two units with dimensions of 3.8 m 3 3.8 m 3 4 m high is set side by side across the flow path of the reactor.\nMoving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)\nThis process uses small, plastic elements (on the order of 7 to 22 mm effective diam-eter) to support the growth of biofilm in the rector. The suspended growth portion of the hybrid is designed as a complete mix reactor. It is commonly mixed with aeration but may also be mixed with a mechanical mixer. The process does not use a return sludge flow. The media (typically polyethylene) is formed in a geometry to provide a high sur-face area (250\u2013515 m\n2/m3). It has a density near that of water ( < 0.96 g/cm3). The \n reactors are normally filled from "}
{"text": "one-third to two-thirds of their empty  volume with media. Because of their shape, less than 15 percent of the water is  displaced. A screen across the outlet is used to prevent the media from leaving the aeration tank. Aeration is typically by coarse bubble diffusers.\n8-8 DISINFECTION\nThe last treatment step in a secondary plant is the addition of a disinfectant to the treated wastewater. The addition of chlorine gas or some other form of chlorine is the process most commonly used for wastewater disinfection in the United States. Chlo-rine is injected into the wastewater by automated feeding systems. Wastewater then flows into a basin, where it is held for about 15 minutes to allow the chlorine to react with the pathogens.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 522  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 522  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWASTEWATER TREATMENT   523\n There is concern that wastewater disinfection may do more harm than good. Early \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules calling for disinfection to achieve 200  fecal coliforms per 100 mL of wastewater have been modified to a requirement for dis-infection only during the summer season when people may come into contact with contaminated water. There were three reasons for this change. The first was that the use of chlorine and, perhaps, ozone causes the formation of or"}
{"text": "ganic compounds that are carcinogenic. The second was the finding that the disinfection process was more effec-tive in killing the predators to cysts and viruses than it was in killing the pathogens themselves. The net result was that the pathogens survived longer in the natural  environment because there were fewer predators. The third reason was that chlorine is toxic to fish.\n8-9 TERTIARY WASTEWATER TREATMENT\nThe need for treatment of wastewater beyond that which can normally be accom-plished in secondary treatment is based on the recognition of one or more of the fol-lowing:\n 1. Increasing population pressures result in increasing loads of organic matter \nand suspended solids to rivers, streams, and lakes.\n 2. The need to increase the removal of suspended solids to provide more \n efficient disinfection.\n 3. The need to remove nutrients to limit eutrophication of sensitive water \n bodies.\n 4. The need to remove constituents that preclude or inhibit water reclamation.\n Initially, in the 1970s, these processes were called \u201cadvanced wastewater treat-\nment\u201d because they employed techniques that were more advanced than secondary treatment methods. In the last three decades many of these technologies have either been directly incorporated into the secondary processes, for example nutrient re-moval, or they are so inherent in meeting stringent discharge standards that they have become conventional. These processes include chemical precipitation, granu-lar filtration, membrane fil"}
{"text": "tration, and carbon adsorption. As conventional pro-cesses, they are better termed tertiary treatment processes rather than an advanced treatment process. In current practice, the employment of air stripping, ion ex-change, NF or RO treatment, and other similar processes to meet water quality  requirements is correctly termed advanced wastewater treatment. Advanced waste-water treatment technologies are, fundamentally, those employed to treat water for reuse. This discussion focuses on the following tertiary treatment processes: granular filtration, membrane filtration, carbon adsorption, chemical phosphorus removal, biological phosphorus removal, and nitrogen control. In addition to solving difficult pollution problems, these processes improve the effluent quality to the point that it is adequate for many reuse purposes, and may con-vert what was originally a wastewater into a valuable sustainable resource too good to throw away.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 523  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 523  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles524  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nFiltration\nSecondary treatment processes, such as the activated-sludge process, are highly effi-\ncient for removal of biodegradable colloidal and soluble organics. However, the typical effluent contains a much higher BOD\n5 than one would expect f"}
{"text": "rom theory. The typical \nBOD is approximately 20 to 50 mg/L. This is principally because the secondary clari-fiers are not perfectly efficient at settling out the microorganisms from the biological treatment processes. These organisms contribute both to the suspended solids and to the BOD\n5 because the process of biological decay of dead cells exerts an oxygen demand.\nGranular Filtration.  By using a filtration process similar to that used in water treat-\nment plants, it is possible to remove the residual suspended solids, including the un-settled microorganisms. Removing the microorganisms also reduces the residual BOD\n5. Conventional sand filters identical to those used in water treatment can be used, \nbut they often clog quickly, thus requiring frequent backwashing. To lengthen filter runs and reduce backwashing, it is desirable to have the larger filter grain sizes at the top of the filter. This arrangement allows some of the larger particles of biological floc to be trapped at the surface without plugging the filter. Multimedia filters accom-plish this by using low-density coal for the large grain sizes, medium-density sand for intermediate sizes, and high-density garnet for the smallest size filter grains. Thus, during backwashing, the greater density offsets the smaller diameter so that the coal remains on top, the sand remains in the middle, and the garnet remains on the bottom. Typically, plain filtration can reduce activated sludge effluent suspended solids from 25 "}
{"text": "to 10 mg/L. Plain filtration is not as effective on trickling filter effluents because trick-ling filter effluents contain more dispersed growth. However, the use of coagulation and sedimentation followed by filtration can yield suspended solids concentrations that are virtually zero. Typically, filtration can achieve 80 percent suspended solids reduction for activated sludge effluent and 70 percent reduction for trickling filter effluent.\nMembrane Filtration.  The alternative membrane processes have been discussed in \nChapter 6. Of the five processes, the one most commonly used in tertiary treatment is \nmicrofiltration (MF). It is used as a replacement for granular filtration. MF processes have achieved BOD removals of 75\u201390 percent and total suspended solids removals of 95\u201398 percent. Performance is highly site-specific. Membrane fouling is of particular concern and on-site pilot testing is highly recommended (Metcalf & Eddy, 2003).\nCarbon Adsorption\nEven after secondary treatment, coagulation, sedimentation, and filtration, soluble or-ganic materials that are resistant to biological breakdown will persist in the effluent. The persistent materials are often referred to as refractory organics. Refractory organ-ics can be detected in the effluent as soluble COD. Secondary effluent COD values are often 30 to 60 mg/L. The most practical available method for removing refractory organics is by ad-\nsorbing them on activated carbon (U.S. EPA, 1979a). Adsorption is the accumulation "}
{"text": "of materials at an interface. The interface, in the case of wastewater and activated car-bon, is the liquid/solid boundary layer. Organic materials accumulate at the interface dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 524  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 524  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWASTEWATER TREATMENT   525\nbecause of physical binding of the molecules to the solid surface. Carbon is activated \nby heating in the absence of oxygen. The activation process results in the formation of many pores within each carbon particle. Since adsorption is a surface phenomenon, the greater the surface area of the carbon, the greater its capacity to hold organic mate-rial. The vast areas of the walls within these pores account for most of the total surface area of the carbon, which makes it so effective in removing organics. After the adsorption capacity of the carbon has been exhausted, it can be restored by heating it in a furnace at a temperature sufficiently high to drive off the adsorbed organics. Keeping oxygen at very low levels in the furnace prevents carbon from burn-ing. The organic matter is passed through an afterburner to prevent air pollution. In small plants where the cost of an on-site regeneration furnace cannot be justified, the spent carbon is shipped to a central regeneration facility for processing.\nChemical Phosphorus "}
{"text": "Removal\nAll the polyphosphates (molecularly dehydrated phosphates) gradually hydrolyze in aqueous solution and revert to the ortho form (PO\n432) from which they were derived. \nPhosphorus is typically found as mono-hydrogen phosphate (HPO 422) in wastewater.\n The removal of phosphorus by chemical precipitation is typically accomplished by \nusing one of three compounds. The precipitation reactions for each are shown below.\nUsing ferric chloride:\n FeCl 31HPO22\n4LFePO 4T1H113Cl2 (8-47)\nUsing alum: Al\n21SO 42312HPO22\n4L2AlPO 4T12H113SO22\n4 (8-48)\nUsing lime: 5Ca(OH)\n213HPO22\n4LCa5(PO 4)3OHT 13H2O16OH2 (8-49)\nYou should note that ferric chloride and alum reduce the pH while lime increases it. \nThe effective range of pH for alum and ferric chloride is between 5.5 and 7.0. If there is not enough naturally occurring alkalinity to buffer the system to this range, then lime must be added to counteract the formation of H\n1.\n The precipitation of phosphorus requires a reaction basin and a settling tank to remove the precipitate. When ferric chloride and alum are used, the chemicals may be added directly to the aeration tank in the activated sludge system. The aeration tank serves as a reaction basin. The precipitate is then removed in the secondary clarifier. This is not possible with lime because the high pH required to form the precipitate is detrimental to the activated sludge organisms.

From Equation 8-47, we see that one mole of ferric chloride is required \nfor each mole of phosphorus to be removed. The pertinent gram molecular weights are as follows:\n FeC\nl35162.2  g\n P530.97  g\nWith a PO 42P of 4.00 mg/L, the theoretical amount of ferric chloride would be\n4.00 3162.2\n30.97520.95, or 21.0 mg/L\nComment:  Because of side reactions, solubility product limitations, and day-to-day variations, the actual amount of chemical to be added must be determined by jar tests on the wastewater. You can expect that the actual ferric chloride dose will be 1.5 to 3 times the theoretically calculated amount. Likewise, the actual alum dose will be  1.25 to 2.5 times the theoretical amount.\nBiological Phosphorus Removal\nIn biological phosphorus removal (BPR or Bio-P), or enhanced biological phosphorous removal (EBPR) as it is sometimes called, the p"}
{"text": "hosphorus in the wastewater is incorpo-rated into cell mass in excess of levels needed for cell synthesis and maintenance. This is accomplished by moving the biomass from an anaerobic to an aerobic environment. The phosphorus contained in the biomass is removed from the process as biological sludge.\nMicrobiology. The original work on enhanced Bio-P identified Acinetobacter as the \nresponsible genus. Subsequent work has identified Bio-P bacteria in other genera such as Arthrobacter, Aeromonas, Nocardia, and Pseudomonas. The Bio-P organisms \nin these genera are referred to as phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs). Based on the work of Comeau et al. (1986), Wentzel et al.  (1986) developed a \nmechanistic model used to explain BPR. This model proposes that (Stephens and Stensel, 1998):\nChemical oxygen demand (COD) is fermented to acetate by facultative bacteria under anaero-\nbic conditions. The bacteria assimilate acetate in the anaerobic zone and convert it to polyhy-droxybutyrate (PHB). Stored polyphosphate is degraded to provide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) necessary for PHB formation, and the polyphosphate degradation is accomplished by the release of orthophosphorus and magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Under aerobic condi-tions, the PHB is oxidized to synthesize new cells and to produce reducing equivalents needed for ATP formation. Phosphate and inorganic cations are taken up, reforming polyphosphate granules. The amount of phosphate taken up under aerobic conditions e"}

Common heterotrophic bacteria in activated sludge have a phospho-\nrus composition of 0.01 to 0.02 g P/g biomass. PAOs are capable of storing phospho-rus in the form of phosphates. In the PAOs, the phosphorus content may be as high as 0.2 to 0.3 g P/g biomass.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 526  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 526  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWASTEWATER TREATMENT   527\n Acetate (i.e., acetic acid \u2013 CH 3COOH) uptake is critical in determining the amount \nof PAOs and, thus, the amount of phosphorus that can be removed by this pathway. If \nsignificant amounts of DO or nitrate enter the anaerobic zone, the acetate will be de-pleted before it is taken up by the PAOs. Bio-P removal is not used in systems that are designed for nitrification without providing a means of denitrification. The amount of phosphorus removal can be estimated from the amount of soluble COD in the wastewater influent. The following assumptions are used to evaluate the stoichiometry of biological phosphorus removal: (1) 1.06 g of acetate/g of COD will be produced as the COD is fermented to volatile fatty acids (VFAs), (2) a cell yield of 0.3 g VSS/g of acetate, and (3) a cell phosphorus content of 0.3 g of P/g VSS. With th"}

Process flow diagrams for several Bio-P processes may be found at the \ntext website: www.mhhe.com/davis. Design principles and practice are presented for Bio-P processes in Water and Wastewater Engineering (Davis, 2010).\nNitrogen Control\nNitrogen in any soluble form (NH 3, NH 41, NO 22, and NO 32, but not N 2 gas) is a nutri-\nent and may need to be removed from wastewater to help control algal growth in the receiving body. In addition, nitrogen in the form of ammonia exerts an oxygen demand and can be toxic to fish. Removal of nitrogen can be accomplished either biologically or chemically. The biological processes are called nitrification/denitrification (NDN or \nBNDN) or sometimes biological nitrogen removal (BNR) . The chemical process is \ncalled ammonia stripping.\nNitrification/Denitrification.  The natural nitrification process can be forced to oc-\ncur in the activated-sludge system by maintaining a cell detention time ( u\nc) of 15 days \nin moderate climates and over 20 days in cold climates. The nitrification step is ex-pressed in chemical terms as follows:\n NH\n1\n412O2\u0394bacteriaNO 321H2O12H1 (8-50)\nOf course, bacteria must be present to cause the reaction to occur. This step satisfies \nthe oxygen demand of the ammonium ion. If the nitrogen level is not of concern for the receiving body, the wastewater can be discharged after settling. If nitrogen i"}

The organic matter may be obtained from within or outside the cell.

{"text": "onia Stripping.  Nitrogen in the form of ammonia can be removed chemically \nfrom water by raising the pH to convert the ammonium ion into ammonia, which can then be stripped from the water by passing large quantities of air through the water. The process has no effect on nitrate, so the activated sludge process must be operated at a short cell-detention time to prevent nitrification. The ammonia stripping reaction is\n NH\n1\n41OH2LNH 31H2O (8-52)\nThe hydroxide is usually supplied by adding lime. The lime also reacts with CO 2 in the \nair and water to form a calcium carbonate scale, which must be removed periodically. \nLow temperatures cause problems with icing and reduced stripping ability. The reduced stripping ability is caused by the increased solubility of ammonia in cold water.\n8-10 LAND TREATMENT FOR SUSTAINABILITY\nThis discussion on land treatment follows two EPA publications: Environmental Con-trol Alternatives: Municipal Wastewater and Land Treatment of Municipal Wastewater Effluents, Design Factors I (Pound et al., 1976). An alternative to the previously discussed tertiary treatment processes for produc-ing an extremely high-quality effluent is offered by an approach called land treatment. \nLand treatment is the application of effluents, usually following secondary treatment, on the land by one of the several available conventional irrigation methods. This ap-proach uses wastewater, and often the nutrients it contains, as a resource rather than considering it as a dis"}
{"text": "posal problem. Treatment is provided by natural processes as the effluent moves through the natural filter provided by soil and plants. Part of the waste-water is lost by evapotranspiration, while the remainder returns to the hydrologic cycle through overland flow or the groundwater system. Most of the groundwater eventually returns, directly or indirectly, to the surface water system. Land treatment of wastewaters can provide moisture and nutrients necessary for crop growth. In semiarid areas, insufficient moisture for peak crop growth and limited water supplies make this water especially valuable. The primary nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) are reduced only slightly in conventional secondary treat-ment processes, so that most of these elements are still present in secondary effluent. Soil nutrients that are consumed each year by crop removal and by losses through soil erosion may be replaced by the application of wastewater. Land application is the oldest method used for treatment and disposal of wastes. Cities have used this method for more than 400 years. Historically, several major  cities, including Berlin, Melbourne, and Paris, have used \u201csewage farms\u201d for waste treatment and disposal. Approximately 1,500 communities in the United States reuse municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent in surface irrigation.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 528  11/14/11  11:50 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 528  11/14/11  11:50 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MH"}

Avoidance of surface discharge of nutrients\n 2. Economic return from use of water and nutrients to produce marketable crops\n 3. Water conservation by exchange when lawns, parks, or golf courses are  irrigated\n 4. Preservation and enlargement of greenbelts and open space\n Where water for irrigation is valuable, crops can be irrigated at consumptive use \nrates (3.5 to 10 mm/d, depending on the crop), and the economic return from the sale of the crop can be balanced against the increased cost of the land and distribution sys-tem. On the other hand, where water for irrigation is of little value, hydraulic loadings can be maximized (provided that renovated water quality criteria are met), thereby minimizing system costs. Under high-rate irrigation (10 to 15 mm/d), water-tolerant grasses with high nutrient uptake become the crop of choice.\nOverland Flow\nOverland flow is essentially a biological treatment process in which wastewater is  applied over the upper reaches of sloped terraces and allowed to flow across the veg-etated surface to runoff collection ditches. Renovation is accomplished by physical, chemical, and biological means as the wastewater flows in a thin sheet down the rela-tively impervious slope. Overland flow can be used as a secondary treatment process where discharge of a nitrified effl"}

The latter objective will allow higher rates of application (18 mm/d or more), depending on the degree of wastewater treatment required. Where a surface discharge is prohib -ited, runoff can be recycled or applied to the land in irrigation or  infiltration-percolation systems.\nRapid Infiltration\nIn infiltration-percolation systems, effluent is applied to the soil at higher rates by spreading in basins or by sprinkling. Treatment occurs as the water passes through the soil matrix. System objectives can include:\n 1. Groundwater recharge\n 2. Natural treatment followed by pumped withdrawal or the use of underdrains \nfor recovery\n 3.

In Phoenix, Arizona, for example, the native groundwater quality is poor, and the renovated water is to be withdrawn by pumping, with discharge into an  irrigation canal.\n8-11 SLUDGE TREATMENT\nIn the process of purifying the wastewater, another problem is created: sludge. The higher the degree of wastewater treatment, the larger the residue of sludge that must be handled. The exceptions to this rule are where land applications or polishing lagoons are used. Satisfactory treatment and disposal of the sludge can be the single most com-plex and costly operation in a municipal wastewater treatment system (U.S. EPA, 1979b). The sludge is made of materials settled from the raw wastewater and of solids generated in the wastewater treatment processes. The quantities of sludge involved are significant. For primary treatment, they may be 0.25 to 0.35 percent by volume of wastewater treated. The activated sludge process \nincreases the volume to 1.5 to 2.0 percent. Use of chemicals for phosphorus removal \ncan add another 1.0 percent. The sludges withdrawn from the treatment processes are still largely water, as much as 97 percent. Sludge treatment processes, then, are con-cerned with separating the large amounts of water from the solid residues. The separated water is returned to the wastewater plant for processing. The basic processes for sludge treatment are as follows:\n 1. Thickening: Separating as much water as"}
{"text": " possible by gravity or flotation.\n 2. Stabilization: Converting the organic solids to more refractory (inert) forms \nso that they can be handled or used as soil conditioners without causing a nuisance or health hazard. These biochemical oxidation processes are called digestion.\n 3. Conditioning: Treating the sludge with chemicals or heat so that the water can be readily separated.\n 4. Dewatering: Separating water by subjecting the sludge to vacuum, pressure, or drying.\n 5. Reduction: Converting the solids to a stable form by wet oxidation or incin-eration. (These are chemical oxidation processes; they decrease the volume of sludge, hence the term reduction.)\n Although a large number of alternative combinations of equipment and processes are used for treating sludges, the basic alternatives are fairly limited. The ultimate depository of the materials contained in the sludge must either be land, air, or water. Current policies discourage practices such as ocean dumping of sludge. Air pollution considerations ne-cessitate air pollution control facilities as part of the sludge incineration process.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 531  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 531  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles532  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The following sections discuss the processes commonly used.

The sand, broken glass, nuts, bolts, and other dense material that is collected in \nthe grit chamber is not true sludge in the sense that it is not fluid. However, it still re-quires disposal. Because grit can be drained of water easily and is relatively stable in terms of biological activity (it is not biodegradable), it is generally trucked directly to a landfill without further treatment.\nPrimary or Raw Sludge.  Sludge from the bottom of the primary clarifiers contains \nfrom 3 to 8 percent solids (1 percent solids . 1 g solids/100 mL sludge volume). The \nsolid fraction is approximately 70 percent organic matter. This sludge rapidly becomes anaerobic and is highly odiferous.\nSecondary Sludge.  This sludge consists of microorganisms and inert materials that \nhave been wasted from the secondary treatment processes. Thus, the solids are about 90 percent organic matter. When the supply of air is removed, this sludge also be-comes anaerobic, creating noxious conditions if not treated before disposal. The solids content depends on the source. Wasted activated sludge is typically 0.5 to 2 percent solids, while trickling filter sludge contains 2 to 5 percent solids. In some cases, sec-ondary "}

The bubbles attach \nthemselves to sludge solids particles and float them to the  surface.

Gravity thickening is a simple and inexpensive process that \nhas been used widely on primary sludges for many years. It is essentially a sedimenta-\ntion process similar to that which occurs in all settling tanks. Sludge flows into a tank that is very similar in appearance to the circular clarifiers used in primary and second-ary sedimentation (Figure 8-30); the solids are allowed to settle to the bottom where a heavy-duty mechanism scrapes them to a hopper from which they are withdrawn for further processing. The type of sludge being thickened has a major effect on perfor-mance. The best results are obtained with purely primary sludges. As the proportion of activated sludge increases, the thickness of settled sludge solids decreases. Purely pri-mary sludges can be thickened from 1\u20133 percent to 10 percent solids.  Dick has described a graphical procedure for sizing gravity thickeners using a batch \nflux curve* (Yoshioka et al., 1957, and Dick, 1970).

If the sludge is to be dewatered and burned, stabilization is not used. There are two basic stabilization processes in use. One is carried out in closed tanks devoid of oxygen and is called anaerobic digestion. \nThe other approach injects air into the sludge to accomplish aerobic digestion.TABLE 8-16 \nReported operation results for gravity thickeners\n  Influent  Mass  Underflow Overflow\n  SS,  loading, concentration, SS,\nLocation Sludge source %  kg/h ? m2  %   mg/L\nPort Huron, MI PS 1 WAS 0.6 1.7 4.7 2,500\nSheboygan, WI PS 1 TF 0.3 2.2 8.6  400\n PS 1 (TF 1 Al) 0.5 3.6 7.8 2,400\nGrand Rapids, MI WAS 1.2 2.1 5.6  140\nLakewood, OH PS 1 (WAS 1 Al) 0.3 2.9 5.6 1,400\n(Source: U.S. EPA, 1979b.) \n(Note: Values shown are average values only.)dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 545  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 545  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/d"}

The aerobic digestion of biological sludges is nothing more \nthan a continuation of the activated sludge process. When a culture of aerobic \n heterotrophs is placed in an environment containing a source of organic material, the microorganisms remove and utilize most of this material. A fraction of the organic material  removed will be used for the synthesis of new biomass. The remaining mate-rial will be channeled into energy metabolism and oxidized to carbon dioxide, water, and soluble inert material to provide energy for both synthesis and maintenance (life-support) functions. Once the external source of organic material is exhausted, however, the microorganisms enter into endogenous respiration, where cellular material is oxi-dized to satisfy the energy of maintenance (that is, energy for life-support require-ments). If this condition is continued over an extended period of time, the total quantity of biomass will be considerably reduced. Furthermore, that portion remaining will exist at such a low energy state that it can be considered biologically stable and suitable for disposal in the environment. This forms the basic principle of aerobic digestion. Aerobic digestion is accomplished by aerating the organic sludges in an open tank resembling an activated sludge aeration tank. Like the activated sludge aeration tank, the "}
{"text": "aerobic digestor must be followed by a settling tank unless the sludge is to be dis-posed of on land in liquid form. Unlike the activated sludge process, the effluent  (supernatant) from the clarifier is recycled back to the head end of the plant. This is because the supernatant is high in suspended solids (100 to 300 mg/L), BOD\n5 (to 500 \nmg/L), TKN (to 200 mg/L), and total P (to 100 mg/L). Approximately 20 to 35 percent of waste-activated sludge from plants with pri-mary treatment is not biodegradable. The goal of aerobic digestion is 38 percent reduc-tion in volatile solids. Both the liquid temperature and SRT control the degree of solids reduction. A plot of degree-days (temperature times SRT) versus volatile solids reduc-tion (Figure 8-33) reveals that 38 percent reduction can be achieved above approxi-mately 400 degree-days. To produce well-stabilized biosolids, at least 550 degree-days are recommended.\n00102030\nPercent volatile solids reduction405060\n200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 2,000\nTemperature /H11034C /H11003 sludge age, days\nFIGURE 8-33\nV olatile solids reduction as a function of digester liquid temperature and digester \nsludge age.

Bench-scale or pilot-scale studies are recommended to obtain site-specific decay coefficients. Because the fraction of volatile matter is reduced, the specific gravity of the di-gested sludge solids will be higher than it was before digestion. Thus, the sludge set-tles to a more compact mass, and the clarifier underflow concentration can be expected to reach 3 percent. The literature addressing dewatering of aerobically digested sludge is contradic-tory. Good results can be obtained with sand drying beds. Mixed results with mechan-ical devices leads to the recommendation to conduct a thorough on-site investigation with pilot-scale devices.\nAnaerobic Digestion.  The anaerobic treatment of complex wastes involves three dis-\ntinct stages. In the first stage, complex"}
{"text": " waste components, including fats, proteins, and polysaccharides, are hydrolyzed to their component subunits. This is accomplished by a heterogeneous group of facultative and anaerobic bacteria. These bacteria then subject the products of hydrolysis (triglycerides, fatty acids, amino acids, and sugars) to fermentation and other metabolic processes leading to the formation of simple organic compounds and hydrogen in a process called acidogenesis or acetogenesis. The organic compounds are mainly short-chain (volatile) acids and alcohols. The second stage is commonly referred to as acid fermentation.  In this stage, organic material is simply converted to organic \n acids, alcohols, and new bacterial cells, so that little stabilization of BOD or COD is real-ized. In the third stage, the end products of the first stage are converted to gases (mainly methane and carbon dioxide) by several different species of strictly anaerobic bacteria. Thus, it is here that true stabilization of the organic material occurs. This stage is generally referred to as methane fermentation. The stages of anaerobic waste treatment are  illustrated in Figures 8-34 and 8-35. Even though the anaerobic process is presented as being sequential in nature, all stages take place simultaneously and synergistically. The primary acid produced during acid fermentation is acetic acid. The significance of this acid as a precursor for methane formation is illustrated in Figure 8-35.dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 547  "}

Thus, the kinetic equations we \n presented to describe the completely mixed activated sludge process are equally  applicable to the anaerobic process. The mesophilic anaerobic digesters are described as standard-rate, two-stage,  separate digesters, and high-rate digesters. The standard-rate process does not employ sludge mixing, but rather allows the digester contents to stratify into zones. The major disadvantage of the standard-rate pro-cess is the large tank volume required because of long retention times, low loading rates, and thick scum-layer formation. Only about one-third of the tank volume is utilized in the digestion process. The remaining two-thirds of the tank volume contains the scum layer, stabilized solids, and the supernatant. It is seldom used for digester design today. The two-stage system evolved as a result of efforts to improve the standard-rate unit. Although many units are now in operation, it is seldom used in modern digester design. In this process, two digesters operating in series separate the functions of fer-mentation and solids/liquid separation. The con"}

Because the contents are thoroughly mixed, temperature distribution is more uniform throughout the tank volume. Sludge feeding and withdrawal are continuous or nearly so. The primary functions of the second-stage digester are solids/liquid separation and residual gas extraction. First-stage digesters may be equipped with fixed or float-ing covers. Second-stage digester covers are often of the floating type. Second-stage units are generally not heated. Separate sludge digestion employs a separate digester for primary sludge and for activated sludge. This arrangement is to improve the separation of the sludge solids from the liquid after digestion. Design criteria for this process are very limited. The most common design today is a single-stage, high-rate digester (Figure 8-36). It is characterized by heating, auxiliary mixing, uniform feeding, and thickening of the feed stream. Uniform feeding of the sludge is very important to the operation of the digester.

The digestion tanks may have fixed or floating covers \n(Figure 8-37). Gas may be stored under the floating cover or in a separate structure. The BOD remaining at the end of digestion is still quite high. Likewise, the  suspended solids may be as high as 12,000 mg/L, while the TKN may be on the order of 1,000 mg/L. Thus, the supernatant from the digester is returned to the head end of the WWTP. The settled sludge is conditioned and dewatered for disposal.\nSludge Conditioning\nChemical Conditioning.

Ash from \nincinerated sludge has also found use as a conditioning agent. As happens when  coagulants are added to turbid water, chemical coagulants act to clump the solids  together so that they are more easily separated from the water. In recent years, organic polymers have become increasingly popular for sludge conditioning. Polymers are easy to handle, require little storage space, and are very effective. The conditioning chemicals are injected into the sludge just before the dewatering process and are mixed with the sludge.\nHeat Treatment.  Another conditioning approach is to heat the sludge at high tem-\nperatures (175 to 230 8C) and pressures (1,000 to 2,000 kPa). Under these conditions, \nmuch like those of a pressure cooker, water that is bound up in the solids is released,  improving the dewatering characteristics of the sludge. Heat treatment has the advan-tage of producing a sludg"}

The process has the disadvantages of relatively complex operation and maintenance and the creation of highly polluted cooking liquors that when recycled to the treatment plant impose a significant added treatment burden.\nSludge Dewatering\nSludge Drying Beds.  The most popular method of sludge dewatering in the past has been the use of sludge drying beds. These beds are especially popular in small plants because of their simplicity of operation and maintenance. Seventy-seven percent of all United States wastewater treatment plants utilized drying beds; one-half of all the  municipal sludge produced in the United States was dewatered by this method (U.S. EPA, 1981). Most of these plants are located in small- and medium-sized communi-ties, with an average flow rate of less than 0.10 m\n3/s. Some larger cities, such as Albe-\nquerque, Fort Worth, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City, use sand drying beds. Although the use of drying beds might be expected in the warmer, sunny regions, they are also used in several large facilities in northern climates. Operational procedures common to all types of drying beds involve the following steps:\n 1. Pump 0.20 to 0.30 m of stabilized liquid sludge onto the drying bed surface.\n 2. Add chemical conditioners continuously, if conditioners are used, by injection \ninto the sludge as it is pumped onto the bed.\n 3. When the bed is filled to the desired level, allow the sludge to dry to the desired \nf"}

(This concentration can vary from 18 to 60 percent, \ndepending on several factors, including type of sludge, processing rate needed, and degree of dryness required for lifting.

Repeat the cycle.\n Sand drying beds are the oldest, most commonly used type of drying bed. Many design variations are possible, including the layout of drainage piping, thickness and type of gravel and sand layers, and construction materials.

Current U.S. practice was discussed and illustrated in Chapter 6.\n Sand drying beds can be built with or without provision for mechanical sludge \nremoval, and with or without a roof. When the cost of labor is high, newly constructed \nbeds are designed for mechanical sludge removal.\nContinuous Belt Filter Presses (CBFP).

{"text": "udges (Figure 8-38).\n The CBFP is successful with many normal mixed sludges. Typical dewatering \n results for digested mixed sludges with initial feed solids of 5 percent give a dewatered \ncake of 19 percent solids at a rate of 32.8 kg/h ? m2. In general, most of the results with \nthese units closely parallel those achieved with rotary vacuum filters. An advantage of \nCBFPs is that they do not have the sludge pickup problem that sometimes occurs with \nrotary vacuum filters. Additionally, they have a lower energy consumption.\nReduction\nIncineration.   If sludge use as a soil conditioner is not practical, or if a site is not \navailable for landfill using dewatered sludge, cities may turn to the alternative of \nsludge reduction. Incineration completely evaporates the moisture in the sludge and \ncombusts the organic solids to a sterile ash. To minimize the amount of fuel used, the \nsludge must be dewatered as completely as possible before incineration. The exhaust \ngas from an incinerator must be treated carefully to avoid air pollution.\n8-12  ALTERNATIVE SLUDGE DISPOSAL TECHNIQUES\n\u201cUltimate disposition\u201d of biosolids or residue (i.e., ash from incineration) falls into \nfour general categories: land application, landfilling, dedicated land disposal, and \n utilization. Land application is discussed in the next section of this chapter.\nFIGURE 8-38\nContinuous belt filter press.

Landfilling of biosolids and/or ash in a sanitary landfill with municipal solid waste is regulated by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 258. Dewatering is typically required and stabilization may be required before the land-fill can be used. If methane recovery is practiced at the landfill site, the addition of biosolids may be welcome as it will increase gas production.\nDedicated Land Disposal\nDedicated land disposal means the application of heavy sludge loadings to some finite land area that has limited public access and has been set aside or dedicated \u201cfor all time\u201d to the disposal of wastewater sludge. Dedicated land disposal does not mean  in-place utilization. No crops may be grown. Dedicated sites typically receive liquid sludges. While application of dewatered sludges is possible, it is not common. In addi-tion, disposal of dewatered sludge in landfills is generally more cost-effective. One of the common sites for dedicated land disposal is a location where surface mining has taken place. The biosolids improve the recovery of the land by providing organic matter and nutrients"}
{"text": " for plant growth.\nUtilization\nWastewater solids may sometimes be used beneficially in ways other than as a soil nutrient. Of the several methods worthy of note, composting and co-firing with  municipal solid waste are two that have received increasing amounts of interest in the last few years. The recovery of lime and the use of the sludge to form activated carbon have also been in practice to a lesser extent.\nLand Application of Biosolids\nOne of the methods for disposal of biosolids/wastewater sludge is by land application. Land application is defined as the spreading of biosolids on or just below the soil surface. The application to land for agricultural purposes is beneficial because the organic matter improves soil structure, soil aggregation, water holding capacity, water infiltration, and soil aeration. In addition, macronutrients (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and micronutrinents (such as iron, manganese, copper, and zinc) aid plant growth. These contributions also serve as a partial replacement for chemical fertilizers. To qualify for application to agricultural and nonagricultural land, the biosolids must, at a minimum, meet the pollutant ceiling concentrations, class B requirements for pathogens, and vector attraction requirements. For biosolids processed for application to lawns and gardens, class A criteria and one of the vector-attraction reduction require-ments must be met. These are discussed later in this section.\nSite Selection. A critical ste"}
{"text": "p in land application of biosolids is the identification of \na suitable site.

The employment of a soil scientist to assist in the  assessment is critical. \nThe plan that determines the selection process should involve all the stakeholders.\nDesign Loading Rates. Nitrogen and heavy metals concentrations in the sludge are two \nof the major concerns in determining the sludge loading rate. The nitrogen limit is typically determined on an annual basis. Heavy-metal loadings are based on long-term averages. The nitrogen loading rate is typically set to match the available nitrogen provided by commercial fertilizers. It is dependent on the crop and can vary from 120 to 245 kg/ha ? y for field crops (corn, wheat, and soybeans) and from 175 to 670 kg/ha ? y for \nforage crops (alfalfa and grasses). Extensive soil testing and analysis by a soil scientist is essential in determining an appropriate loading rate.\nApplication Metho"}
{"text": "ds.  The application methods are broadly classified as liquid \napplication and dewatered biosolids application.\n Liquid biosolids application is attractive because of its simplicity. Dewatering pro-cesses are not required. The solids concentrations range from 1 to 10 percent. The  application method may be by vehicular application or by irrigation. Vehicular application may be either surface distribution or subsurface distribution. Special vehicles are used. They have wheels designed to minimize compaction and to im-prove mobility. For surface distribution, rear-mounted spray manifolds, nozzles, or guns are used. For subsurface injection, two alternatives are commonly used. Injection shanks force the liquid into the ground directly. Alternatively, plows or discs with manifolds apply the biosolids, which are then incorporated immediately after injection by covering spoons. Injection below the soil surface is preferred as it minimizes odors, reduces vector at-traction, minimizes ammonia loss, eliminates surface runoff, and minimizes visibility, which leads to better public acceptance. However, this method is not suitable for all crops. Irrigation may be by sprinkling or furrow irrigation. These methods find applica-tion in locations isolated from public view and access. They have the following disad-vantages: high power costs for the pumps, contact of all parts of the crop with the biosolids, potential odors, vector attraction, and high visibility to the public. Application of "}
{"text": "dewatered solids is similar to the application of semisolid animal manure. Typical solids concentrations are in the range of 15 to 20 percent. It must be followed by incorporation. This method has the potential to generate dust and odors as well as being an attraction to vectors. Public acceptance of this application method may be difficult to achieve.\nSludge Disposal Regulations\nOn February 19, 1993, the EPA promulgated risk-based regulations that govern the use or disposal of sewage sludge. These regulations are codified as 40 CFR Part 503 and have become known as the \u201c503 Regulations.\u201d The regulations apply to sewage sludge generated from the treatment of domestic sewage that is land-applied, placed on a sur-face disposal site, or incinerated in an incinerator that accepts only sewage sludge. The regulations do not apply to sludge generated from treatment of industrial process wastes at an industrial facility, hazardous sewage sludge, sewage sludge with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations of 50 mg/L or greater, or drinking water sludge. Figure 8-39 summarizes the sludge quality requirements for use or disposal. The regulation establishes two levels of sewage sludge quality with respect to dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 554  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466dav01145_ch08_455-577.indd Page 554  13/10/11  6:03 AM user-f466 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesBulk sewage\nslud"}

All class A pathogen reduction alternatives require that either fecal coliform density be less than 1,000 most probable number (MPN) per gram of total solids, or Salmonella bacteria be less than 3 MPN per 4 grams of total solids. The class A treatment alternatives include treating the sludge for a specified time and tem-perature combination, heat-enhanced alkaline stabilization, treatment in a process to further reduce pathogens (PFRP), and use of processes that are proven to reduce virus plaque-forming units and helminth ova to less than 1 per 4 grams of sludge. PFRPs include composting, heat drying, heat treatment, thermophilic aerobic digestion, beta- and gamma-ray irradiation, and pasteurization. The class B pathogen standard is less than 2 million fecal coliforms per gram of sludge or treatment in a process to significantly reduce pathogens (PSRP). The PSRPs include aerobic digestion, air dry-ing, anaerobic digestion, composting, and lime stabilization. Sludges meeting the class A pathogen densities may be land-disposed immediately.

On-site systems are generally small and may serve individual homes, small housing developments (clus-ters), or isolated commercial establishments, such as small hotels or restaurants. In the United States, about 25 percent of the population is served by on-site wastewater sys-tems. In some states as much as 50 percent of the population utilize on-site systems within rural and suburban communities (U.S. EPA, 1997). As many people choose to move to rural and outer suburban areas, the number of decentralized systems is in-creasing. It is estimated that as much as 40 percent of new housing construction is taking place in areas that are not connected to municipal sewers.\nAlternative O"}
{"text": "n-Site Treatment and Disposal Systems with Water\nSeptic Tanks and Absorption Fields.  About 85 to 90 percent of on-site wastewater disposal systems are conventional septic systems. A conventional septic system con-sists of three parts: the septic tank , a distribution box, and an absorption field (also \ncalled a leach or drain or tile field) (see Figure 8-1). The septic tank and tile field are a unit. Neither part will function as intended without the other. The main function of the septic tank (Figure 8-2) is to remove large particles and grease that would otherwise clog the tile field. Heavy solids settle to the bottom, where they undergo biological decomposition. Grease floats to the surface and is trapped. It is only slightly decomposed.\n8-1FIGURE 8-1\nSchematic of a conventional septic system.

For  individual homes the following guidelines can be used: 3 m\n3 tank minimum; 4 m3 for \na three-bedroom house; 5 m3 for a four-bedroom house and 6 m3 for a five-bedroom house.\n Bacterial action in the tank helps to degrade the organic matter in the wastewater. The BOD\n5 of the wastewater is also reduced by the separation of the solids from the \nliquid. For domestic systems, the BOD 5 of the influent is typically 210 mg/L. The septic \ntank effluent has a BOD 5 of about 180 mg/L without an effluent filter and about 130 \nmg/L if an effluent filter is used in the system. Usually the BOD 5 limit to allow wastewa-\nter to be discharged to surface waters is 20 mg/L or less, so the BOD 5 of a septic effluent \nis too high to allow for surface water discharge. However, as further treatment occurs in the soil, absorption fields can be used to safely dispose of the partially treated septic tank effluent. A distribution box is used to distribute the septic tank effluent throughout the absorption field. The absorption field usually consists of a series of trenches that contain perforated PVC pipes that are about 10 cm diameter. The pipes placed over a 15-cm-deep layer of drainrock and then buried with an additional layer of drainrock. The drain-rock is covered building fabric or building paper (which helps to prevent the migration of fines into the drainrock) and finally the trench is filled with native soil (F"}
{"text": "igure 8-3). The trenches should be separated by a distance of at least 2 meters. When the system is operational, bacteria produce a slime layer at the bottom of the trench. This layer is commonly called the clogging mat. The clogging mat creates a barrier that slows the movement of water into the surrounding soil. This allows the flow in the surrounding soil to remain unsaturated, which allows air to move through the soil. This maintains aerobic conditions, which are essential to obtain proper treat-ment of the effluent. The size of the absorption area depends upon the wastewater flow and the permea-bility of the surrounding soil. The permeability of the soil is determined by a percolation (or perc) test. The perc test is conducted by digging a hole of a prescribed size, filling it dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Page 2  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Page 2  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWASTEWATER TREATMENT   8-3\nNative soil backfill\n5-cm minimum\nrock over pipe\n15-cm minimum ofrock under pipe10-cm distribution pipeFabric or\nbuilding paper\nSide wallabsorption area(both sides)30-cm minimum\n45\u201360-cm minimum90-cm max15-cm minimum\n2\u20136-cm diameter\nwashed drainrock\nwith water and measuring the rate at which the water percolates into the soil.

{"text": "lity of the soil is to dig a trench in the area proposed for the tile field and visually inspect it. The inspector looks for unsuit-able soil (clay, for example) and the presence of mottled (discolored) soil. Mottled soil indicates that the groundwater table has, at some point in time, risen to a level which would interfere with the operation of the tile field and, perhaps more important, bring the groundwater into direct contact with sewage. The information in Table 8-1 is then used to determine the size of the tile field. Further limitations on the use of a septic-tank tile-field system usually include the following:\n 1. The tile field must be located more than 30 m from any well, surface water, \nfooting drain, or storm drain.\n 2. The tile field must be located at least 3 m from any property line.\n 3.

The earth cover placed over the absorption tile must not be less than 0.3 m nor \nmore than 0.6 m deep.\n 5. A clean aggregate graded between 12 and 36 mm must be placed around the \ntile pipe. It must be a minimum of 50 mm above the pipe and 150 mm below \nthe pipe, with a total depth of not less than 300 mm.\n Most states limit septic tank/tile field installation to facilities producing less than 40 m\n3/d of wastewater. This limits their use to single-family residences, small apart-\nments, freeway rest areas, parks, and isolated commercial establishments.\nExample 8-1.  Peter and Pam Piper are considering the purchase of a plot of land on \nwhich to build a retirement home. According to their water bills for the past 5 years, their average daily water consumption is about 0.4 m\n3.

If the septic tank must provide a detention time of 24 h, then its volume \nshould be\nV50.4 m3/d31 d 50.4 m3\nHowever, the minimum recommended volume is 4.0 m3.

The normal lifetime of an absorption \nfield is 20 to 30 years. After that time the soil around the field becomes clogged with organic matter and the system will not operate properly. Many factors can cause the system to fail prematurely. Roots can block pipes or the pipes may be crushed if a vehicle is driven over the field. The system may also fail if the absorption field is hydraulically overloaded or if substances that are toxic to soil bacteria, such as solvents, paints, pesticides or softener salt are disposed of down the drain. However, the most common reason for premature failure is improper maintenance. Because the rate of dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Page 4  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Page 4  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_page"}

If these solids are not removed, the clear water zone between the sludge layer and the scum layer becomes too small. This leads to an increased carryover of solids to the  absorption field. If too many solids reach the absorption field, then it can become clogged, resulting in premature failure of the field. To prevent the accumula-tion of too much sludge and scum in a septic tank, they should be periodically re-moved. The rate of accumulation of sludge depends on the usage of the system. It is suggested that the level of sludge in the tank be checked annually, though usually a domestic system will need to be pumped out only once every 2 or 3 years.\nSeptic Tank and Absorption Field Modifications.  As mentioned above, often the \nreason for the failure of absorption fields in poorly drained soils is that the growth of the clogging mat is excessive. Reduction of the BOD of the wastewater can reduce the rate of growth of the mat. Two types of treatment systems that are commonly used to reduce the wastewater BOD are aerobic treatment systems and sand filters.\nAerobic Systems.  A wide range of aerobic treatment systems are available. The \ncommon feature of these units is that they use some mechanism to inject or circulate air inside the treatment tank. If sufficient air is introd"}
{"text": "uced, then aerobic conditions can be achieved in the wastewater. As aerobic degradation is rapid, good removal of BOD can be achieved under these conditions. This reduces the rate of growth of the clogging mat and extends the life of the absorption field.\nSand Filter Systems.  The sand filter is also an aerobic treatment system. The com-\nponents of a typical sand filter are illustrated in Figure 8-4. The filter consists of a bed of granular material (usually sand, but other materials such as anthracite can be used). The surface of the bed is intermittently dosed with wastewater that percolates through the sand to the bottom of the filter. The sand bed is dosed anywhere from 12 to 72 times per day. The size of the dose should be such that the sand bed does not become saturated. This allows the wastewater to flow as a thin film around the sand particles, so good contact between the wastewater and the air can be achieved. Sand filters may be single-pass or multipass. Single-pass sand filters are commonly called intermittent sand filters (ISFs). In a single-pass system the wastewater is collected in the underd-rain and passed onto an absorption field or other disposal system. In a multipass sys-tem a portion of the treated wastewater is recycled back through the sand bed. Recirculation dilutes the wastewater coming from the septic tank. By diluting the strength of the  effluent, higher application rates can be used. Recirculating sand filters take up 3 to 5 times less area than s"}
{"text": "ingle-pass sand filters. Also, better nitrogen re-moval is achieved in recirculating sand filters because of nitrification/denitrification (see Chapter 5).\nDosing Systems.  Another solution to the clogging problem can be to replace the \nconventional absorption trenches with a disposal system that is less prone to failure. In \na conventional absorption field the effluent flows by gravity into the trenches. The gravity system may be replaced by a dosing system, similar to that used in a sand filter. This helps to maintain unsaturated conditions in the soil surrounding the trench.dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Page 5  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Page 5  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles8-6  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nShallow Absorption Fields.  In these systems the distribution piping is often cov-\nered with large half pipe rather than gravel. The trenches are only about 0.25 m deep. \nBetter treatment can be achieved, as the upper soil layers have a higher concentration of microbes.\nOn-Site Treatment/Disposal Systems for Unfavorable Site Conditions\nWhere site conditions are unfavorable for conventional septic systems, alternative treatment/disposal systems may be required.

Mounds were first developed at the North Dakota Agricultural \nCollege in the 1940s. They were known as NODAK systems. The components of a \ntypical mound system are illustrated in Figure 8-5. Mounds are both treatment and disposal systems, as the effluent from the mound percolates directly into the native soil. The design overcomes certain site restrictions such as slowl"}
{"text": "y permeable soils, shallow permeable soils over porous bedrock, and permeable soils with high water tables. A mound system is a pressure-dosed absorption system that is elevated above the natural soil surface. Effluent from the septic tank is pumped or siphoned to the elevated  absorption area and distributed through a piping network located in the coarse aggregate at the top of the mound. The effluent then passes through the aggregate and infiltrates the sand fill. Treatment occurs in the sand and in the fill below the sand bed. As the water percolates downward, it spreads out over a large area. The size of the mound must be such that area of native soil under the mound, called the basal area, is \nlarge enough that wastewater does not seep out of the base or sides of the mound. Dur-ing construction of mound systems, special attention should be given to ensuring that the basal area of the system is properly scarified, and that compaction of the basal area by earthmoving equipment is minimal. Compaction of the top layer of the soil can greatly reduce the rate of infiltration into the soil.\nBarriered-Landscape Water-Renovation System (BLWRS).   In the summer of \n1969, Dr. A. Earl Erickson demonstrated the efficacy of utilizing a BLWRS (pro-\nnounced \u201cblowers,\u201d like \u201cflowers\u201d) to denitrify water containing 100 mg/L of nitrate. Subsequently, he and his associates demonstrated that the BLWRS could be used to renovate both dairy cow and swine feedlot wastewater (Table 8-2) (Erickson"}
{"text": " et al., 1974). The system is, of course, equally applicable to domestic wastewater. The BLWRS differs from the NODAK mound system in that the mound of soil is underlain by an impervious water barrier (Figure 8-6a and b). As the renovated water passes beyond the edge of the barrier, it may be collected in drains or be allowed to recharge the aquifer. The mound is constructed of a fine sand. The dimensions of the BLWRS depend on the soil texture and expected wastewater application rates. A 0.15-m layer of topsoil is used to cover the sand.

The wastewater is spread on the top of the mound by a sprinkler. As the waste-water percolates down, the organic particles are filtered out and remain on the surface. The particles are oxidized by soil microorganisms. The soluble organic compounds and other ions move into the aerobic soil zone. Most of the soluble organic matter is oxidized by bacteria in the highly active aerobic soil. The phosphate ions are held on the clay fraction of the soil and sand bed. "}
{"text": "(Iron slag and/or limestone can be used to enhance the phosphorus adsorption capacity.) The ammonium ions are held on the soil until they are nitrified to nitrate. The downward movement of the nitrified water is stopped by the barrier. The water then is forced to move laterally through the anoxic layer. Denitrification occurs as the waste passes out of the carbon source. The BLWRS must be operated in a cyclic fashion to allow the soil microorganisms time to degrade the waste and to maintain aerobic conditions in the soil. Application rates between 9 and 18 mm of wastewater per day may be used, provided that the BLWRS is \u201crested\u201d for one-third of the time. The physical conditions of the soil gov-ern the application rates. Ponding on the surface indicates excessive application rates.\nOther On-Site Treatment/Disposal Options\nConstructed wetlands can be used for on-site wastewater treatment/disposal. The use of these systems is more common in warmer climates. In arid areas, evapotranspiration (ET) beds are an alternative to conventional absorption beds. In an evapotranspiration system, water tolerant vegetation is planted in a shallow sand bed. The plant roots draw the water up through the sand and it is evaporated or transpired to the atmosphere.

The absence of a water supply or water scarcity may preclude the use of flush toilets. In this case, other sys-tems for the disposal of human waste need to be considered. Commonly used systems are the pit privy and vault, chemical and composting toilets. Vault, chemical, and com-posting toilets are closed systems, so there is \u201czero\u201d discharge from these systems on site. The waste produced is collected and disposed of elsewhere. For this reason, these systems may also be used in environmentally sensitive areas where the discharge of wastewater may be environmentally unacceptable.\nThe Pit Privy.  Although most modern environmental engineering and science texts \nwould skip this subject, the mere existence of 10,000 of these or their modern equiva-lent in the United States is just too much for us to ignore. Furthermore, the facts of the matter are that junior engineers and environmental scientists are the most likely candi-dates for designing, erecting, operating, dismantling, and closing the beasts.dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Page 9  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Page 9  1/5/12  5:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav0"}

Rainwater is to be prevented from entering the pit. A cup of kerosene at weekly intervals discourages mosquito breeding, and odors can be reduced by the use of a cup of hydrated lime. Unfortu-nately, the lime also slows the decomposition of paper, so its use is not encouraged. Disinfectants should never be used.\nThe Vault Toilet.  This is the modern version of the pit privy. Its construction is the \nsame as that of the pit privy with the exception that the pit is formed as a watertight vault. A special truck (fondly called a \u201choney wagon\u201d) is used to pump out the vault at regular intervals. Because of the liquefying action of the bacteria and biological decomposition in the liquid (rather than in the soil as occurs with the pit privy), vault toilets are much more odiferous than the old pit privies. Many masking agents (per-fumes) and disinfectants are available to mitigate the stench. Unfortunately, most of them have unpleasant odors themselves. If electricity is at hand, an ozone generator, set to vent into the gas space above the waste, will perform near-miracles in odor  reduction.\nThe Chemical Toilet.  The airplane toilet, the c"}
{"text": "oach-bus toilet, and the self-contained \ntoilets of recreation vehicles are all versions of the chemical toilet. The essence of the system is a strong disinfectant chemical used to carry the waste to a holding tank and render it inoffensive until it can be pumped from the holding tank. While these vehicu-lar systems are quite effective, the chemical must be selected with an eye toward its impact on the treatment system that ultimately must receive it. The chemical toilet has not found wide acceptance in permanent installations. This is because of the cost of the chemical and the impracticality of maintenance.\nThe Composting Toilet.  A composting toilet consists of a large tank located directly \nbelow the toilet room. Wastes enter the tank through a large-diameter chute that con-\nnects to the toilet. No water is used for the toilet, but a bulking agent (such as wood shavings) is added to improve liquid drainage and aeration. A small fan draws air through the tank and up the vent pipe to ensure adequate oxygen for decomposition and odorless operation. The liquid in the waste is evaporated, leaving a compost. The finished compost can be removed from the lower end of the tank about once each year. It can be used as a fertilizer. Power requirements for the system are very low, so if power from an electrical grid is not available, the electrical requirements can be met from an independent generating system, such as a photovoltaic system.dav01145_studentwebsite_ch08_001-011.indd Pag"}

Industrial and mobile sources contribute to meso-scale air pollution that contaminates the ambient air that surrounds us outdoors. Macro-scale effects include transport of ambient air pollutants over large distances and global im-pact. Examples of macro-scale impacts include acid rain and ozone pollution. Global impacts of air pollution result from sources that may potentially change the upper  atmosphere. Examples include depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. While micro- and macro-scale effects are of concern, our focus will predominately be on meso-scale air pollution.\nApplications\nAfter a brief review of the ideal gas law, this chapter provides an overview of air pol-lution standards for ambient air, the origin and fate of a selected list of air pollutants, and air pollution at various scales ranging from indoor pollutants to global warming.

Because no heat enters or leaves the gas, the work will go into increasing the thermal energy of the gas in accordance with the first principle of thermodynamics, that is,\n (Heat added to gas) 5 (Increase in thermal energy)\n 1 (External work done by or on the gas)\nBecause the left side of the equation is zero (because it is an adiabatic process), the \nincrease in thermal energy is equal to the work done. The increase in thermal energy is reflected by an increase in the temperature of the gas. If the gas is expanded adiabati-cally, its temperature will decrease.\nUnits of Measure\nThe three basic units of measure used in reporting air pollution data are micrograms per cubic meter ( mg/m\n3), parts per million (ppm), and the micron ( m) or, preferably, its \nequivalent, the micrometer ( mm). Micrograms per cubic meter and parts per million \nare measures of concentration. B"}
{"text": "oth m g/m3 and ppm are used to indicate the concen-\ntration of a gaseous pollutant. However, the concentration of particulate matter may be reported only as mg/m\n3. The mm is used to report particle size.\n There is an advantage to the unit ppm that frequently makes it the unit of choice. The advantage results from the fact that ppm is a volume-to-volume ratio. (Note that this is different than ppm in water and wastewater, which is a mass-to-mass ratio.) Changes in temperature and pressure do not change the ratio of the volume of pollut-ant gas to the volume of air that contains it. Thus, it is possible to compare ppm read-ings from Denver and Washington, DC, without further conversion.\nConverting Mg/m\n3 to ppm.  The conversion between m g/m3 and ppm is based on the \nfact that at standard conditions (0 8C and 101.325 kPa), one mole of an ideal gas occu-\npies 22.414 L.

The EPA used these studies to establish the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). These standards are for the ambient air, that is, the outdoor air that normally surrounds us. EPA calls the pollutants listed in Table 9-1 on page 584 criteria pollutants because they were developed on health-based criteria. The primary standard  \nwas established to protect human health with an \u201cadequate margin of safety.\u201d The secondary standards are intended to prevent environmental and property damage. In \n1987, the EPA revised the NAAQS. The standard for hydrocarbons was dropped and the standard for Total Suspended Particulates (TSP) was replaced with a particulate standard based on\u00a0the mass of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10\u00a0 mm. This standard is referred to as the PM\n10 standard. It was dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 582  11/2/11  11:20 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 582  11/2/11  11:20 AM user-f462 Volume/201/es/MHRL070/ros71837_disk1of1/0070071837/ros71837_pagefilesVolume/201/es/MHRL070/ros71837"}

States are divided into Air Quality Control Regions (AQRs). An AQR that has air \nquality equal to or better than the primary standard is called an attainment area. Those areas that do not meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. Under the 1970 CAA, the EPA was directed to establish regulations for hazardous \nair pollutants (HAPs) using a risk-based approach. These were called NESHAPs\u2014 national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants. Because EPA had difficulty defining \u201can ample margin of safety\u201d as required by the law, only seven HAPs were regulated between 1970 and 1990: asbestos, arsenic, benzene, beryllium, mercury, vi-nyl chloride, and radionuclides.

Because emissions vary as driving conditions change, a standard driving cycle is defined for testing vehi-cles for compliance.

{"text": "hanisms of deterioration have been attrib-\nuted to air pollution: abrasion, deposition and removal, direct chemical attack, indirect \nchemical attack, and electrochemical corrosion (Yocom and McCaldin, 1968). Solid particles of large enough size and traveling at high enough speed can cause deterioration by abrasion. With the exception of soil particles in dust storms and lead particles from automatic weapons fire, most air pollutant particles either are too small or travel at too slow a speed to be abrasive. Small liquid and solid particles that settle on exposed surfaces do not cause more than aesthetic deterioration. For certain monuments and buildings, such as the White House, this form of deterioration is in itself quite unacceptable. For most surfaces, it is the cleaning process that causes the damage. Sandblasting of buildings is an obvious case in point. Frequent washing of clothes weakens their fiber, while frequent washing of painted surfaces dulls their finish. Solubilization and oxidation/reduction reactions typify direct chemical attack. Frequently, water must be present as a medium for these reactions to take place. Sulfur dioxide and SO\n3 in the presence of water react with limestone (CaCO 3) to \nform calcium sulfate (CaSO 4) and gypsum (CaSO 4 ? 2H 2O). Both CaSO 4 and \nCaSO 4 ? 2H 2O are more soluble in water than CaCO 3, and both are leached away \nwhen it rains. The tarnishing of silver by H 2S is a classic example of an oxidation/\nreduction reaction. Indirec"}
{"text": "t chemical attack occurs when pollutants are absorbed and then react with some component of the absorbent to form a destructive compound. The compound may be destructive because it forms an oxidant, reductant, or solvent. Further, a com-pound can be destructive by removing an active bond in some lattice structure. Leather becomes brittle after it absorbs SO\n2, which reacts to form sulfuric acid because of the \npresence of minute quantities of iron. The iron acts as a catalyst for the formation of the acid. A similar result has been noted for paper. Oxidation/reduction reactions cause local chemical and physical differences on metal surfaces. These differences, in turn, result in the formation of microscopic an-odes and cathodes. Electrochemical corrosion results from the potential that develops in these microscopic batteries.\nFactors that Influence Deterioration.   Moisture, temperature, sunlight, and position \nof the exposed material are among the more important factors that influence the rate of \ndeterioration. Moisture, in the form of humidity, is essential for most of the mechanisms of dete-rioration to occur. Metal corrosion does not appear to occur even at relatively high SO\n2 dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 588  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 588  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesAIR POLLUTION   589\npollution lev"}

Rain reduces the \neffects of pollutant-induced corrosion by dilution and washing away of the pollutant.\n Higher air temperatures generally result in higher reaction rates. However, when \nlow air temperatures are accompanied by cooling of surfaces to the point where moisture \ncondenses, then the rates may be accelerated.\n In addition to the oxidation effect of its ultraviolet wave lengths, sunlight stimu-\nlates air pollution damage by providing the energy for pollutant formation and cyclic \nreformation. The cracking of rubber and the fading of dyes have been attributed to \nozone produced by these photochemical reactions.\n The position of the exposed surface influences the rate of deterioration in two \nways. First, whether the surface is vertical or horizontal or at some angle affects de-\nposition and wash-off rates. Second, whether the surface is an upper or lower one may \nalter the rate of damage. When the humidity is sufficiently high, the lower side usually \ndeteriorates faster because rain does not remove the pollutants as efficiently.\nEffects on Vegetation\nCell and Leaf Anatomy.

The nucleus contains the hereditary material (DNA), which controls \nthe operation of the\u00a0cell. The protoplasm located outside the nucleus is called cyto-plasm. Within the  cytoplasm are tiny bodies or plastids. Examples include chloroplasts, leucoplasts, chromoplasts, and mitochondria. Chloroplasts contain the chlorophyll that manufactures the plant\u2019s food through photosynthesis. Leucoplasts convert starch into starch grains. Chromoplasts are responsible for the red, yellow, and orange colors of fruit and flowers.

{"text": "the underside of the leaf is called a stoma. (The plural of stoma is stomata.) The mesophyll, which includes both the palisade parenchyma and the spongy parenchyma, contains chloroplasts. It is the food production center. The vascular bundles carry water, minerals, and food throughout the leaf and to and from the main stem of the plant. The guard cells regulate the passage of gases and water vapor in and out of the leaf. When it is hot, sunny, and windy, the processes of photosynthesis and respiration are increased. The guard cells open, which allows increased removal of water vapor that otherwise would accumulate because of the increased transport of water and min-erals from the roots.\nPollutant Damage.  Ozone injures the palisade cells (Hindawi, 1970). The chloro-\nplasts condense and ultimately the cell walls collapse. This results in the formation of red-brown spots that turn white after a few days. The white spots are called fleck. Ozone \ninjury appears to be the greatest during midday on sunny days. The guard cells are more likely to be open under these conditions and thus allow pollutants to enter the leaf.\nUpper epidermal cells\nPalisade\nparenchyma\nMesophyll\ncells\nAir\nspaces\nChloroplastsSpongy\nparenchyma\nLowerepidermal cells\nGuard cell (enlarged)Vascular\nbundle\nFIGURE 9-4\nCross section of intact leaf.

Levels \nof NO 2 in excess of 2.5 ppm for periods of four hours or more are required to produce \nnecrosis (surface spotting due to plasmolysis or loss of protoplasm).\n Sulfur dioxide injury is also typified by necrosis, but at much lower levels. A con-centration of 0.3 ppm for eight hours is sufficient (O\u2019Gara, 1922). Lower levels for longer periods of exposure will produce a diffuse chlorosis (bleaching). The net result of air pollutant damage goes beyond the apparent superficial dam-age to the leaves. A reduction in surface area results in less growth and small fruit. For commercial crops this results in a direct reduction in income for the farmer. For other plants the net result is likely to be an early death. Fluoride deposition on plants not only causes them damage but may result in a second untoward effect. Grazing animals may accumulate an excess of fluoride that mottles their teeth and ultimately causes them to fall out.\nProblems of Diagnosis.   Various factors make it difficult to diagnose actual air pol-\nlution damage. Droughts, insects, diseases, herbicide overdoses, and nutrient deficien-\ncies all can cause injury that resembles air pollution damage. Also, combinations of pollutants that alone cause no damage are known to produce acute effects when com-bine"}
{"text": "d (Hindawi, 1970). This effect is known as synergism.\nEffects on Health\nSusceptible Population.   It is difficult at best to assess the effects of air pollution on \nhuman health. Personal pollution from smoking results in exposure to air pollutant con-centrations far higher than the low levels found in the ambient atmosphere. Occupational exposure may also result in pollution doses far above those found outdoors. Tests on  rodents and other mammals are difficult to interpret and apply to human anatomy. Tests on human subjects are usually restricted to those who would be expected to survive. This\u00a0leads us to a question of environmental ethics. If the allowable concentration levels (standards) are based on results from tests on rodents, they would be rather high. If the allowable concentration levels must also protect those with existing cardiorespiratory ailments, they should be lower than those resulting from the observed effects on rodents. We noted earlier that the air quality standards were established to protect public health with an \u201cadequate margin of safety.\u201d In the opinion of the Administrator of the EPA, the standards must protect the most sensitive responders. Thus, as you will note in the following paragraphs, the standards have been set at the lowest level of observed effect. This decision has been attacked by some theorists. They say it would make bet-ter economic sense to build more hospitals (Connolly, 1972). However, one also might apply this kind of logic in "}

The respiratory system is the primary indica-\ntor of air pollution effects in humans. The major organs of the respiratory system are the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs (Figure 9-5). The nose, pharynx, larynx, and trachea together are called the upper respiratory tract (URT). The primary effects of air pollution on the URT are aggravation of the sense of smell and inactiva-tion of the sweeping motion of cilia, which remove mucus and entrapped particles. dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 591  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 591  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles592  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nThe lower respiratory tract  (LRT) consists of the branching structures known as bron-\nchi and the lung itself, which is composed of grape-like clusters of sacs called alveoli . \nThe alveoli are approximately 300 mm in diameter. The walls of alveoli are lined with \ncapillaries. Carbon dioxide diffuses through the capillary wall into the alveolus, while \noxygen diffuses out of the alveolus into the blood cell. The difference in partial pres-\nsure of each of the gases causes it to move from the higher to lower partial pressure.\nInhalation and Ret"}
{"text": "ention of Particles.   The degree of penetration of particles into \nthe LRT is primarily a function of the size of the particles and the rate of breathing. \nParticles greater than 5 to 10 mm are screened out by the hairs in the nose. Sneezing \nalso helps the screening process. Particles in the 1 to 2 mm size range penetrate to the \nalveoli. These particles are small enough to bypass screening and deposition in the \nURT, however they are big enough that their terminal settling velocity allows them to \ndeposit where they can do the most damage.

{"text": "AIR POLLUTION   593\nChronic Respiratory Disease.  Several long-term diseases of the respiratory system \nare seriously aggravated by and perhaps may be caused by air pollution. Airway resis-\ntance is the narrowing of air passages because of the presence of irritating substances. The result is that breathing becomes difficult. Bronchial asthma is a form of airway resistance that results from an allergy. An asthma \u201cattack\u201d is the result of the narrowing of the bron-chioles because of a swelling of the mucous membrane and a thickening of the secretions. The bronchioles return to normal after the attack. Chronic bronchitis is currently defined \nto be present in a person when excess mucus in the bronchioles results in a cough for three months a year for two consecutive years and lung infections, tumors, and heart disease must be absent. Pulmonary emphysema is characterized by a breakdown of the alveoli. The small grape-like clusters become a large nonresilient balloon-like structure. The amount of surface area for gas exchange is reduced drastically. Cancer of the bronchus  \n(lung cancer) is characterized by abnormal, disorderly new cell growth originating in the bronchial mucous membrane. The growth closes off the bronchioles. It is usually fatal.\nCarbon Monoxide (CO).   This colorless, odorless gas is lethal to humans within a \nfew minutes at concentrations exceeding 5,000 ppm. CO reacts with hemoglobin in the \nblood to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). Hemoglobin has a greater affi"}
{"text": "nity for CO than it does for oxygen. Thus, the formation of COHb effectively deprives the body of oxygen. At COHb levels of 5 to 10 percent, visual perception, manual dexterity, and ability to learn are impaired. A concentration of 50 ppm of CO for eight hours will result in a COHb level of about 7.5 percent. At COHb levels of 2.5 to 3 percent, people with heart disease are not able to perform certain exercises as well as they might in the absence of COHb. A concentration of 20 ppm of CO for eight hours will result in a COHb level of about 2.8 percent (Ferris, 1978). (We should note here that the average concentration of CO inhaled in cigarette smoke is 200 to 400 ppm!) The sensitive populations are those with heart and circulatory ailments, chronic pulmonary disease, developing fetuses, and those with conditions that cause increased oxygen demand, such as fever from an infections disease.\nHazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs).   Most of the information on the direct human \nhealth effects of hazardous air pollutants (also known as air toxics) comes from studies \nof industrial workers. Exposure to air toxics in the workplace is generally much higher than in the ambient air. We know relatively little about the specific effects of the HAPs at the low levels normally found in ambient air. The HAPs regulated under the NESHAP program were identified as causal agents for a variety of diseases. For example, asbestos, arsenic, benzene, coke oven emissions, and radionuclides may cause cancer"}
{"text": ". Beryllium primarily causes lung disease but also affects the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lymph glands.  Mercury has been especially targeted for regulation because it is released during the combustion of coal. Thus, it is one of the few HAPs that is widespread in the environment. Of particular concern are children who are exposed to methyl mercury prenatally. They are at increased risk of poor performance on neurobehavioral tasks such as those measur-ing attention, fine motor function, language skills, visual-spatial abilities and verbal mem-ory (U.S. EPA, 1997, and U.S. EPA, 2004).dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 593  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 593  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles594  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nLead (Pb).  In contrast to the other criteria air pollutants, lead is a cumulative poison. \nA further difference is that it is ingested in food and water, as well as being inhaled. Of that portion taken by ingestion, approximately 5 to 10 percent is absorbed in the body. Between 20 and 50 percent of the inspired portion is absorbed. Those portions that are not absorbed are excreted in the feces and urine. Lead is measured in the urine and blood for diagnostic evidence of lead poisoning. An early manifestation of acute lead poisoning is a mild anemia (deficiency of red\u00a0blood cells). Fatigue,"}
{"text": " irritability, mild headache, and pallor indistinguishable from\u00a0other causes of anemia occur when the blood level of lead increases to 60 to 120\u00a0mg/100 g of whole blood. Blood levels in excess of 80 m g/100 g result in consti-\npation and abdominal cramps. When an acute exposure results in blood levels of lead greater than 120 mg/100 g, acute brain damage (encephalopathy) may result \n(Goyer and Chilsolm, 1972). Such acute exposure results in convulsions, coma, car-diorespiratory arrest, and death. Acute exposures may occur over a period of one to three weeks. Chronic exposure to lead may result in brain damage characterized by seizures, mental incompetence, and highly active aggressive behavior. Weakness of extensor muscles of the hands and feet and eventual paralysis may also result. Canfield et al. (2003) found a decline in intelligence quotient (IQ) of 7.4 points for a lifetime blood lead concentration of up to 10 mg per deciliter. For a lifetime average blood lead con-\ncentration ranging from more than 10 mg per deciliter to 30 m g per deciliter, a more \ngradual decrease of 2.5 IQ points was observed. Atmospheric lead occurs as a particulate. The particle size range is between 0.16 and 0.43 m m. Nonsmoking residents of suburban Philadelphia exposed to approxi-\nmately 1 m g/m\n3 of lead in air have blood levels averaging 11 mg/100 g. Nonsmoking \nresidents of downtown Philadelphia exposed to approximately 2.5 mg/m3 of lead have \nblood levels averaging 20 mg/100 g (U.S. PHS, 1"}
{"text": "965). In the early 1990s, 4.4 percent of U.S. children ages 1 to 5 had elevated lead levels. The percentage dropped to 1.6 percent by 2002. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed this drop to the removal of lead from gasoline as well as other efforts to screen and treat children for lead exposure (U.S. CDC, 2005).\nNitrogen Dioxide (NO\n2).  Exposure to NO 2 concentrations above 5 ppm for 15 min-\nutes results in cough and irritation of the respiratory tract. Continued exposure may \nproduce an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lung (pulmonary edema). The gas is reddish brown in concentrated form and gives a brownish yellow tint at lower concen-trations. At 5 ppm it has a pungent sweetish odor. The average NO\n2 concentration \nin  tobacco smoke is approximately 5 ppm. Slight increases in respiratory illness and  decrease in pulmonary function have been associated with concentrations of about 0.10\u00a0ppm (Ferris, 1978). You should note that these concentrations are very high with respect to the NAAQS in Table 9-1.\nPhotochemical Oxidants.   Although the photochemical oxidants include peroxyace-\ntyl nitrate (PAN), acrolein, peroxybenzoyl nitrates (PBzN), aldehydes, and nitrogen \noxides, the major oxidant is ozone (O\n3). Ozone is commonly used as an indicator of \nthe total amount of oxidant present.

At a concentration of 0.3 ppm, cough and chest discomfort are increased. \nThose people who suffer from chronic respiratory disease are particularly susceptible.\nPM 10.  As noted earlier, large particles are not inhaled deeply into the lungs. This is \nwhy EPA switched from an air quality standard based on total suspended matter to \none based on particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mm (PM 10). Studies \nin the United States, Brazil, and Germany have related higher levels of particulates to  increased risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, and cancer-related deaths, as well as pneumonia, lung function loss, hospital admissions, and asthma (Reichhardt, 1995). Particles 2.5 mm in aerodynamic diameter have been identified as a major con-\ntributor to elevated death rates in polluted cities (Pope et al., 1995). One hypothesized biological mechanism is pollution-induced lung damage resulting in declines in lung function, in respiratory distress, and in cardiovascular disease potentially related to  hypoxemia (Pope et al., 1999).\nSulfur Oxides (SO\nx) and Total Suspended Particulates (TSP).   The sulfur oxides \ninclude sulfur dioxide (SO 2), sulfur trioxide (SO 3), their acids, and the salts of their \nacids. Rather than try to separate the effects of SO 2 and SO 3, they are usually treated \nto"}

The SO 2 in the absence of particulates would be ab-\nsorbed in the mucous membranes of the URT. Patients suffering from chronic bronchitis have shown an increase in respiratory symptoms when the TSP levels exceeded 350 m g/m\n3 and the SO 2 level was above \n0.095 ppm. Studies made in Holland at an interval of three years showed that  pulmonary function improved as SO\n2 and TSP levels dropped from 0.10 ppm \nand\u00a0230\u00a0mg/m3 to 0.03 ppm and 80 mg/m3, respectively.\nAir Pollution Episodes.  The word episode is used as a refined form of the word \ndisaster. * Indeed, it was the shock of these disasters that stimulated the first modern \nlegislative action to require control of air pollutants. The characteristics of the three major episodes are summarized in Table 9-5. Careful study of the table will reveal that all of the episodes had some things in common. Comparison of these situations and others where no episode occurred (that is, where the number of dead and ill was con-siderably less) has revealed that four ingredients are essential for an episode. If one ingredient is omitted, fewer people will get sick and only a few people can be expected to die. The crucial ingredients are: (1) a large number of pollution sources, (2) a restricted air volume, (3) failure of officials to recognize that anything is wrong, and (4) the presence of water droplets of the \u201cright\u201d si"}
{"text": "ze (Goldsmith, 1968). Although a sufficient quantity of any pollutant is lethal by itself, it is generally agreed that some mix is required to achieve the results seen in these episodes. Atmo-spheric levels of individual pollutants seldom rise to lethal levels without an explosion or transportation accident. However, the proper combination of two or more pollutants will yield untoward symptoms at much lower levels. The sulfur oxides and particulates were the most suspect in the three major episodes.\n*In the nuclear power business, they would call it an \u201cincident.\u201ddav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 595  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 595  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles596  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The meteorology must be such that there is little air movement. Thus, the pollut-\nants cannot be diluted. Although a valley is most conducive to a stagnation effect, the London episode proved that it isn\u2019t necessary. The stagnant conditions must persist for several days. Three days appears to be the minimum. Tragically, each of these hazardous air pollution conditions became lethal because of the failure of city officials to notice anything strange.

Pollutants that dissolve into the fog droplet are thus carried deep into the lungs \nand deposited there.\n9-5 ORIGIN AND FATE OF AIR POLLUTANTS\nCarbon Monoxide\nIncomplete oxidation of carbon results in the production of carbon monoxide. The \nnatural anaerobic decomposition of carbonaceous material by microorganisms releases  approximately 160 teragrams* (T\ng) of methane (CH 4) to the atmosphere each year \nworldwide (IPCC, 1995). The natural formation of CO results from an intermediate step in the oxidation of the methane. The hydroxyl radical (OH ?) serves as the initial \noxidizing agent. It combines with CH\n4 to form an alkyl radical (Wofsy et al., 1972).\n CH 41OH#SCH 3?1 H2O (9-8)\nThis reaction is followed by a complex series of 39 reactions, which we have over-simplified to the following:\n CH\n3?1 O212(hy)SCO1H21OH# (9-9)\nThis says that CH 3? and O 2 are each zapped by a photon of light energy (h y). The \n symbol y stands for the frequency of the light. The h is Planck\u2019s constant 5 6.626 3 \n10234 J/Hz.\n Anthropogenic sources (tho"}
{"text": "se associated with the activities of human beings) in-\nclude motor vehicles, fossil fuel burning for electricity and heat, industrial processes, \nsolid waste disposal, and miscellaneous burning of such things as leaves and brush. Approximately 600\u20131250 Tg of CO are released by these sources (IPCC, 1995).  Motor vehicles account for more than 60 percent of the emission. No significant change in the global atmospheric CO level has been observed over the past 20 years. Yet the worldwide anthropogenic contribution of combustion sources has doubled over the same time period. Because there is no apparent change in the atmospheric concentration, a number of mechanisms ( sinks) have been proposed to \naccount for the missing CO. The two most probable are\n 1. Reaction with hydroxyl radicals to form carbon dioxide\n 2. Removal by soil microorganisms\nIt has been estimated that these two sinks annually consume an amount of CO that just \nequals the production (Seinfeld, 1975).\nHazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs)\nThe EPA has identified 166 categories of major sources and 8 categories of area sources for the HAPs listed in Table 9-2 (57 FR 31576). The source categories repre-sent a wide range of industrial groups: fuel combustion, metal processing, petroleum \n*One teragram 5 1 3 1012 grams.dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 597  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 597  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/"}

There are also a number of miscellaneous source categories, such as dry cleaning and electroplating. In addition to these direct emissions, air toxics can result from chemical formation reactions in the atmosphere. These reactions involve chemicals emitted to the atmo-sphere that are not listed HAPs and may not be toxic themselves, but can undergo at-mospheric transformations to generate HAPs. For organic compounds present in the gas phase, the most important transformation processes involve photolysis and chemi-cal reactions with ozone, hydroxyl radicals (OH? ), and nitrate radicals (Kao, 1994). \nPhotolysis is the chemical fragmentation or rearrangement of a chemical upon the ad-sorption of radiation of the appropriate wavelength. Photolysis is only important dur-ing the daytime for those chemicals that absorb strongly within the solar radiation spectrum. Otherwise, reaction with OH?  or O\n3 is likely to predominate. The HAPs \nmost often formed are formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The major removal mechanisms appear to be OH abstraction or addition. The  reaction products lead to the formation of CO and CO\n2. Eighty-nine of the 188 HAPs \nhave atmospheric lifetimes of less than one day.\nLead\nV olcanic"}
{"text": " activity and airborne soil are the primary natural sources of atmospheric lead. Smelters and refining processes, as well as incineration of lead-containing wastes, are major point sources of lead. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of the lead that used to be added to gasoline was discharged to the atmosphere. Submicron lead particles, which are formed by volatilization and subsequent con-densation, attach to larger particles or they form nuclei before they are removed from the atmosphere. Once they have attained a size of several microns, they either settle out or are washed out by rain.\nNitrogen Dioxide\nBacterial action in the soil releases nitrous oxide (N 2O) to the atmosphere. In the upper \ntroposphere and stratosphere, atomic oxygen reacts with the nitrous oxide to form nitric oxide (NO).\n N\n2O1OS2NO (9-10)\nThe atomic oxygen results from the dissociation of ozone.

The NO in turn re-acts with ozone or oxygen to form NO\n2. The anthropogenic contribution to global \nemission of NO x amounted to 32 Tg/y (as N) in 1995 (IPCC, 1995). Between 40 and \n45\u00a0percent of the NO x emissions in the United States come from transportation, 30 to \n35 percent from power plants, and 20 percent from industrial sources (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). The U.S. EPA emission factors provide an example of a method for estimating emissions from coal-fired electric utility boilers.

Thus, they are called secondary pollutants. They are formed through a series of reactions that are initiated by the absorption of a photon by an atom, molecule, free radical, or ion. Ozone is the principal photochemical oxidant. Its formation is usually attributed to the nitrogen dioxide photolytic cycle. Hydrocarbons modify this cycle by reacting with atomic oxygen to form free radicals (highly reactive organic species). The hydrocar-bons, nitrogen oxides, and ozone react and interact to produce more nitrogen dioxide and ozone. This cycle is represented in summary form in Figure 9-6. The whole reac-tion sequence depends on an abundance of sunshine.

Anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel burning and industrial processes account for emissions of 110 Tg per year (Kiehl and Rodhe, 1995). For example, the emission factor for a pulverized coal-fired, dry bottom, wall-fired boiler is given as 10A where \u201cA\u201d is the percent ash in the coal.

H 2S and SO 2 are converted to sulfates. NO x and NH 3 are con-\nverted to nitrates. The hydrocarbons react to form products that condense to form particles at atmospheric temperatures. Natural sources of secondary pollutants yield about 240 Tg annually. Anthropogenic sources yield about 340 Tg annually (Kiehl and Rodhe, 1995). Dust particles that are entrained (picked up) by the wind and carried over long \ndistances tend to sort themselves out to the sizes between 0.5 and 50 mm in diameter. \nSea salt nuclei have sizes between 0.05 and 50 mm. Particles formed as a result of \nphotochemical reactions tend to have very small diameters ( , 0.4 mm). Smoke and fly \nash particles cover a wide range of sizes from 0.05 to 200 mm or more.

Micro-scale problems range from those covering less than a centimeter to those the size of a house or slightly larger. Meso-scale air pollution problems are those of a few hectares up to the size of a city or county. Macro-scale problems extend from counties to states, nations, and in the broadest sense, the globe.

In this section we will address the general micro-scale and macro-scale problems recognized today.\nIndoor Air Pollution\nPeople who live in urban, cold climates may spend more than 90 percent of their time indoors (Lewis, 2001). In the last three decades, researchers have identified sources, concentrations, and impacts of air pollutants that arise in conventional domestic resi-dences.

In numerous instances, people have died from furnace malfunction. More recently, chronic low levels of CO pollution have been recognized. Gas ranges, ovens, pilot lights, gas and kerosene space heaters, and cigarette smoke are sources of CO (Table 9-6). Nitrogen oxide sources are also shown in Table 9-6. NO\n2 levels have been found \nto range from 70 mg/m3 in air-conditioned houses with electric ranges to 182 mg/m3 in \nnon-air-conditioned houses with gas stoves (Hosein et al., 1985).

Smokers were allowed to smoke only in the designated lounge area. Period 1 was prior to the implementation of the new policy. It is obvious that the new policy had a positive effect outside of the lounge. On the other hand, respirable particulate matter (RSP) was found to increase with one smoker and to rise dramatically with\u00a0two. Indoor tobacco smoking is of particular concern because of the carcinogenic prop-erties of the smoke.

The 2002 serum levels of cotinine were 75 percent less in adults and 68 percent less in children than 10 years previously. CDC attributed this dramatic decrease to restrictions to reduce secondhand smoke. Yet, more needs to be done.

{"text": "is naturally acidic because CO 2 from the atmosphere dissolves to a \nsufficient extent to form carbonic acid (see Chapter 5). The equilibrium pH for pure rainwater is about 5.6. Measurements taken over North America and Europe have  revealed lower pH values. In some cases individual readings as low as 3.0 have been recorded. The average pH in rain weighted by the amount of precipitation over the United States and lower Canada in 1997 is shown in Figure 7-15. Chemical reactions in the atmosphere convert SO\n2, NO x, and volatile organic \n compounds (VOCs) to acidic compounds and associated oxidants (Figure 9-7). The primary conversion of SO\n2 in the eastern United States is through the aqueous \nphase reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) in clouds. Nitric acid is formed by \nthe re action of NO 2 with OH radicals formed photochemically. Ozone is formed \nand then protected by a series of reactions involving both NO x and VOCs.\n As discussed in Chapter 7, the concern about acid rain relates to potential effects of acidity on aquatic life, damage to crops and forests, and damage to building materi-als. Lower pH values may affect fish directly by interfering with reproductive cycles or by releasing otherwise insoluble aluminum, which is toxic. Dramatic dieback of trees in Central Europe has stimulated concern that similar results could occur in North America. It is hypothesized that the acid rain leaches calcium and magnesium from the soil (see Figure 6-10). This lowers the molar "}

This study was titled the National Acid Precipitation Assess-ment Program (NAPAP). In September 1987, the NAPAP released an interim report that indicated that acidic precipitation appeared to have no measurable and consistent effect on crops, tree seedlings, or human health, and that a small percentage of lakes across the United States were experiencing pH values lower than 5.0 (Lefohn and Krupa, 1988). On the other hand, oxidant damage was measurable. Approximately 70 percent of the SO\n2 emissions in the United States are at-\ntributable to electric utilities. In order to decrease the SO 2 emissions, the Congress \n developed a "}
{"text": "two-phase control program under Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Phase I sets emission allowances for 110 of the largest emitters in the Eastern half of the U.S. Phase II will include smaller utilities. The utilities may buy or sell allowances. Each allowance is equal to about 1 Mg of SO\n2 emissions. If a com-\npany does not expend its maximum allowance, it may sell it to another company. This program is called a market-based system. As a result of this program utility emissions have decreased by 9 Tg. In 2003, the EPA reported on the long-term response of surface water chemistry to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (U.S. EPA, 2003a). Eighty-one selected sites in the Northeast and Upper Midwest have been monitored for acidity since the early 1980s. The EPA\u2019s estimate of changes in the number and proportion of acidic surface waters is summarized in Table 9-10. In two areas, the New England lakes and the Blue Ridge Province streams, there is little evidence of reduction in acidity over the last decade. Sulfate levels have decreased significantly while nitrate levels have not changed appreciably. The widespread decrease in sulfate concentration parallels the general decrease in national emissions of sulfur dioxide since 1980. The EPA con-cluded from its analysis that surface waters have responded relatively rapidly to the decline in sulfate deposition and that additional reductions in deposition will result in additional declines in sulfate concentration.\nTABLE 9-10"}

(On the other hand, as we have already noted, ozone can be lethal.) The presence of ozone in the upper atmosphere (20 to 40 km and up) provides a barrier to ultraviolet (UV) ra-diation. The small amounts that do seep through provide you with your summer tan. Too much UV will cause skin cancer. Although oxygen also serves as a barrier to UV radiation, it absorbs only over a "}

The M refers to any third body (usually N\n2).\n In 1974, Molina and Rowland (1974) revealed a potential air pollution threat to this protective ozone shield. It is noteworthy that they, along with Paul Crutzen, jointly received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their research. They hypothesized that chlo-rofluorocarbons (CF\n2Cl2 and CFCl 3\u2014often abbreviated as CFC), which are used as \naerosol propellants and refrigerants, react with ozone (Figure 9-9). The frightening  aspects of this series of reactions are that the chlorine atom removes ozone from the system, and that the chlorine atom is continually recycled to convert more ozone to oxygen. It has been estimated that a 5 percent reduction in ozone could result in nearly a 10 percent increase in skin cancer (ICAS, 1975). Thus, CFCs that are rather inert compounds in the lower atmosphere become a serious air pollution problem at higher elevations. By 1987, the evidence that CFCs destroy ozone in the stratosphere above Antarctica every spring had become irrefutable. In 1987, the ozone hole was larger than ever. More than half of the total ozone column was wiped out and essentially all ozone dis-appeared from some regions of the stratosphere.\nFIGURE 9-8\nPhotoreactions of ozone.

Initially, it was believed that this phenomenon was peculiar to the geography and climatology of Antarctica and that the warmer northern hemisphere was strongly protected from the processes that lead to massive ozone losses. Studies of the North Pole stratosphere in the winter of 1989 re-vealed that this is not the case (Zurer, 1989). In September 1987, the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer was developed. The Protocol, which was initially ratified by 36 countries and became effective in January 1989, proposed that CFC production first be frozen and then reduced 50 percent by 1998. Yet, under the terms of the Protocol, the chlorine content of the atmosphere would continue to grow because the fully halogenated CFCs have such long lifetimes in the atmosphere. CF\n2Cl2, for example, has a lifetime \nof 110 years (Reisch and Zurer, 1988). Eighty countries met at Helsinki, Finland, in the spring of 1989 to assess new information.

The two groups of compounds that emerged as significant replacements for the CFCs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocar-bons (HCFCs). In contrast to the CFCs, HFCs and HCFCs contain one or more C-H bonds. This makes them susceptible to attack by OH radicals in the lower atmosphere. Because HFCs do not contain chlorine, they do not have the ozone depletion potential associated with the chlorine cycle shown in Figure 9-9. Although HCFCs contain chlo-rine, this chlorine is not transported to the stratosphere because OH scavenging in the troposphere is relatively efficient. The implementation of the Montreal Protocol appears to be working. The use of CFCs has been reduced to one-tenth of the 1990 levels (UN, 2005). Total tropospheric chlorine from the long- and short-lived chlorocarbons was about 5 percent lower in 2000 than that observed at its peak in 1992\u20131994. The rate of change in 2000 was about 222 parts per trillion per year. Total chlorine from CFCs is no longer increasing, \nin contrast to the slight increase noted in 1998. Total tropospheric bromine from halons continues to increase at about 3 percent per year, which is about two-thirds of the 1996 rate (UNEP/WHO, 2002).

The case for global warming has grown very strong over the last two decades. As shown in Figure 9-10, the 5-year running average temperature in 2000 was almost 0.6 8C above the 1951\u20131980 average (Hansen and Sato, 2004). \nMann and Jones (2003) have compiled proxy temperature data from sediments, ice cores, and tree-ring temperature reconstruction over the past two millennia. Their research shows (Figure 9-11) the average global surface temperature has been in-creasing for the last 100 years and was higher in 2000 than in any time in the past 2,000 years. To understand the physics of global warming we will use the simplest model of energy balance. It does not take into account location on the planet, time, precipitation, wind, ocean currents, soil moisture, or any of a number of other variables. The model is a simple radiation balance based on the principles described in Chapter 2. It equates the solar energy absorbed by the earth from the sun with the energy radiated back into space from the earth. We begin with a definition of the solar constant. The solar constant is the average \nannual intensity of the radiation that is intercepted by the cross section of a sphere equivalent to the earth\u2019s diameter, normal to the incident radiation jus"}

As the atoms in gas vibrate and rotate, they absorb and radiate energy in specific wavelengths. If the frequency of the molecular oscillations is close to the frequency of the passing radiant energy, the molecule can absorb that energy. The absorption occurs over a limited range of frequencies. It is different for each molecule. A plot of the percent absorption of solar radiation versus wavelength is called the absorption spectrum  \n(Figure 9-13b ). The sum of the absorption of the gases at ground level is shown in the \nbottom frame of Figure 9-13 b. The shaded areas show radiation that is absorbed. The \nunshaded areas show radiation that is transmitted. These areas are often referred to as radiation \u201cwindows\u201d. From Figure 9-13b , it is evident that essentially all of the incoming solar radiation at \nwavelengths in the ultraviolet range (,  0.3 m m) is absorbed by oxygen and ozone. This \nabsorption occurs in the stratosphere. It shields us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. At the other end of the spectrum, radiatively active gases that absorb at wave-lengths greater than 4 mm are called greenhouse gases (GHGs). This absorption heats the atmosphere, which radiates energy back to earth as well as into space.

The more GHGs in the atmosphere, the more effective it is in restricting the outflow of long-wave (infrared) radiation. These greenhouse gases act as a blanket that raises the earth\u2019s temperature above the 256 K calculated from the radiation balance. To elaborate on the radiation balance, we must take into account reflection by clouds and aerosols, evapotranspiration, latent heat release, and convective heat trans-fer. The simple global mean energy balance shown in Figure 9-14 summarizes the major energy flows. The hypothesis is that increasing levels of certain gases (the so-called greenhouse gases, GHGs) leads to global warming. Unlike ozone, the greenhouse gases are  relatively transparent to short-wave ultraviolet light from the sun.

As of December 2005, 157 nations had ratified the accord and the United States remained unwilling to make any commitments to reduce greenhouse emissions (AP, 2005a). Russia\u2019s ratification of the treaty sounded a bell for a new international financial market in which companies buy and sell what amounts to global-warming pollution permits. The Protocol mandates emission reductions only from industrialized coun-tries. However, it allows the industrialized countries to finance projects that reduce their emissions in developing countries and, thus, to generate credits toward their  quotas. The theory is that, because global warming is global, the atmosphere doesn\u2019t care where the emissions or the emission reductions occur. Because financing an emissions-reduction project in a developing country is cheaper than in an industrialized country, there is a great incentive to put together investment funds. Although the United States did not a ratify the Protocol, 136 U.S. mayors repre-senting more than 30 million people have signed an agreement to meet the goals spelled out in the treaty (AP, 2005b).

On April 2, 2007, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized, that while automobile emissions may not by itself reverse global warming, it does not follow that the court lacks jurisdiction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to slow or reduce it. The court decided that because greenhouse gases fit well within the act\u2019s capacious definition of \u201cair pol-lutant,\u201d EPA has statutory authority to regulate emission of such gases from new motor vehicles. The court further noted that under the act\u2019s clear terms, EPA can avoid pro-mulgating regulations only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change (Supreme Court, 2007).\nA Rationale for Action.

It is continually expanding and compress-\ning gases, exchanging heat, and generally raising chaos. The driving energy for this unwieldy machine comes from the sun. The difference in heat input between the equa-tor and the poles provides the initial overall circulation of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The rotation of the earth coupled with the different heat conductivities of the oceans and land produce weather.\nHighs and Lows.

The highs and lows depicted on weather maps are simply areas of greater and lesser pressure. The elliptical lines shown on more detailed weather maps are lines of constant pressure, or isobars. A two-dimensional plot of pressure \nand distance through a high- or low-pressure system would appear as shown in Figure 9-15. The wind flows from the higher pressure areas to the lower pressure areas. On a nonrotating planet, the wind direction would be perpendicular to the isobars (Figure\u00a09-16a). However, since the earth rotates, an angular thrust called the Coriolis \neffect is added to this motion.

{"text": "oul weather. Tornadoes and hurricanes are the foulest of the cyclones. Wind speed is in part a function of the steepness of the pressure surface. When the isobars are close together, the pressure gradient (slope) is said to be steep and the wind speed relatively high. If the isobars are well spread out, the winds are light or nonexistent.\nTurbulence\nMechanical Turbulence.  In its simplest terms, we may consider turbulence to be the addition of random fluctuations of wind velocity (that is, speed and direction) to the overall average wind velocity. These fluctuations are caused, in part, by the fact that the atmosphere is being sheared. The shearing results from the fact that the wind speed is zero at the ground surface and rises with elevation to near the speed imposed by the pressure gradient. The shearing results in a tumbling, tearing motion as the mass just above the surface falls over the slower moving air at the surface. The swirls thus formed are called eddies. These small eddies feed larger ones. As you might  expect, the greater the mean wind speed, the greater the mechanical turbulence. The more mechanical turbulence, the easier it is to disperse and spread atmospheric pollutants.\nThermal Turbulence.  Like all other things in nature, the rather complex interaction \nthat produces mechanical turbulence is confounded and further complicated by a third party. Heating of the ground surface causes turbulence in the same fashion that heating the bottom of a beaker full of "}

The cold ground, in turn, cools the air above it, caus-ing a sinking density current.\nStability\nThe tendency of the atmosphere to resist or enhance vertical motion is termed stability.  \nIt is related to both wind speed and the change of air temperature with height (lapse rate). For our purpose, we may use the lapse rate alone as an indicator of the stability condition of the atmosphere. There are three stability categories. When the atmosphere is classified as unstable, \nmechanical turbulence is enhanced by the thermal structure. A neutral atmosphere is \none in which the thermal structure"}
{"text": " neither enhances nor resists mechanical turbulence. When the thermal structure inhibits mechanical turbulence, the atmosphere is said to be stable. Cyclones are associated with unstable air. Anticyclones are associated with \nstable air.\nNeutral Stability.  The lapse rate for a neutral atmosphere is defined by the rate of \ntemperature increase (or decrease) experienced by a parcel of dry air that expands (or contracts) adiabatically (without the addition or loss of heat) as it is raised through the atmosphere. This rate of temperature decrease (dT/ dz) is called the dry \nadiabatic lapse rate. It is designated by the Greek letter gamma ( G). It has a value of \napproximately 21.008 C/100 m*. (Note that this is not a slope in the normal sense, \nthat is, it is not dy/ dx.) In Figure 9-17a , the dry adiabatic lapse rate of a parcel of air \nis shown as a dashed line and the temperature of the atmosphere (ambient lapse rate) is shown as a solid line. Since the ambient lapse rate is the same as G, the atmo-\nsphere is said to have a neutral stability.\nUnstable Atmosphere.  If the temperature of the atmosphere falls at a rate greater \nthan G, the lapse rate is said to be superadiabatic, and the atmosphere is unstable. Us-\ning Figure 9-17b, we can see that this is so.

The air inside \nthe balloon will be warmer than the air outside; this temperature difference gives the balloon buoyancy. It will behave as a hot gas and continue to rise without any further mechanical effort. Thus, mechanical turbulence is enhanced and the atmosphere is unstable. If we adiabatically displace the balloon downward to elevation C, the tempera-ture inside the balloon would rise at the rate of the dry adiabat. Thus, in moving 100 m, the temperature will increase from 21.158  to 22.158 C. The temperature outside the \n*The value for \u0393 for dry air is 9.76\u00b0C/km.

If the temperature of the atmosphere falls at a rate less than \nG, it is called subadiabatic, and the atmosphere is stable. If we again capture a bal-\nloon of polluted air at elevation A (Figure 9-17c ) and adiabatically displace it verti-\ncally to elevation B, the temperature of the polluted air will decrease at a rate equal to the dry adiabatic rate. Thus, in moving 100 m, the temperature will decrease from 21.158  to 20.158 C as before. However, because the ambient lapse rate is 2 0.58C/100 m, \nthe temperature of the air outside the balloon will have dropped to only 20.65 8C. \nBecause the air inside the balloon is cooler than the air outside the balloon, the bal-loon will have a tendency to sink. Thus, the mechanical displacement (turbulence) is inhibited. In contrast, if we displace the balloon adiabatically to elevation C, the temperature inside the balloon would increase to 22.15 8C, while the ambient temperature would \nincrease to 21.65 8C. In this case, the air inside the balloon would be warmer than the \nambient air and the balloon would tend to rise. Again, the mechanical displacement would be inhibited.

A heat island results from a mass of material, either natural or anthro-pogenic, that absorbs and reradiates heat at a greater rate than the surrounding area. This causes moderate to strong vertical convection currents above the heat island. The effect is superimposed on the prevailing meteorological conditions. It is nullified by strong winds. Large industrial complexes and small to large cities are examples of places that may have a heat island. Because of the heat island effect, atmospheric stability will be less over a city than it is over the surrounding countryside. Depending upon the location of the\u00a0pollutant sources, this can be either good news or bad news. First, the good news: For ground level sources such as automobiles, the bowl of unstable air that forms will allow a greater air volume for dilution of the pollutants. Now the bad\u00a0news: Under stable con-ditions, plumes from tall st"}

Unfortunately, the instability caused by the heat island mixes these plumes to the ground level.\nLand/Sea Breezes.  Under a stagnating anticyclone, a strong local circulation pat-\ntern may develop across the shoreline of large water bodies. During the night, the land cools more rapidly than the water. The relatively cooler air over the land flows toward the water (a land breeze, Figure 9-19). During the morning the land heats faster than water. The air over the land becomes relatively warm and begins to rise. The rising air is replaced by air from over the water body (a sea or lake breeze, Figure 9-20). The effect of the lake breeze on stability is to impose a surface-based inversion on the temperature profile. As the air moves from the water over the warm ground, it is \nWarmCoolLand breezeAir over land\ncools and descends\nWarm air over\nwater rises\nFIGURE 9-19\nLand breeze during the night.dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 629  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 629  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles630  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nheated from below.

When the general circulation imposes moderate to strong winds, valleys \nthat are oriented at an acute angle to the wind direction channel the wind. The valley effectively peels off part of the wind and forces it to follow the direction of the valley floor (Figure 9-22). Under a stagnating anticyclone, the valley will set up its own circulation. Warming of the valley walls will cause the valley air to be warmed. It will become more buoyant and flow up the valley. At night the cooling process will cause the wind to flow down the valley.FIGURE 9-20\nLake breeze during the day.CoolWarmLake breezeWarm air over land\nrises\nCool air\nFumigation\nFanningSeveral km\nLakeuZ\nTZ\nT\nFIGURE 9-21\nEffect of lake breeze on plume dispersion.dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 630  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 630  10/25/11  11:09 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesAIR POLLUTION   631\n Valleys oriented in the north-south direction are more susceptible to inversions \nthan level terrain.

We have discussed all of these except the source conditions. Now we wish to integrate the first and third factors to describe the qualitative aspects of calculating pollutant concentrations. We shall follow this with simple quantitative models for a point source and a line source. More complex models for point sources (in rough terrain, in industrial settings, or for long time periods), area sources, and mobile sources are left for more advanced texts.\nSource Characteristics.   Most industrial effluents are discharged vertically into the \nopen air through a stack or duct. As the contaminated gas stream leaves the discharge \npoint, the plume tends to expand and mix with the ambient air. Horizontal air move-ment will tend to bend the discharge plume toward the downwind direction. At some point between 300 and 3,000 m downwind, the effluent plume will level off. While the effluent plume is rising, bending, and beginning to move in a horizontal direction, the\u00a0gaseous effluents are being diluted by the ambient air surrounding the plume. As the contaminated gases are diluted by larger and larger volumes of ambient air, "}

The vertical inertia is related to the exit gas velocity and mass. The plume\u2019s buoyancy is related to the exit gas mass relative to the surrounding air mass. Increasing the exit velocity or the exit gas temperature will generally increase the\u00a0plume rise. The plume rise, together with the physical stack height, is called the effective stack height. The additional rise of the plume above the discharge point as the plume bends and levels off is a factor in the resultant downwind ground level concentrations. The higher the plume rises initially, the greater distance there is for diluting the contaminated gases as they expand and mix downward. For a specific discharge height and a specific set of plume dilution conditions, the ground level concentration is proportional to the amount of contaminant materials dis-charged from the stack outlet for a spe"}
{"text": "cific period of time. Thus, when all other condi-tions are constant, an increase in the pollutant discharge rate will cause a proportional increase in the downwind ground level concentrations.\nDownwind Distance.  The greater the distance between the point of discharge and a \nground level receptor downwind, the greater will be the volume of air available for diluting the contaminant discharge before it reaches the receptor.\nWind Speed and Direction.  The wind direction determines the direction in which \nthe contaminated gas stream will move across local terrain. Wind speed affects the plume rise and the rate of mixing or dilution of the contaminated gases as they leave the discharge point. An increase in wind speed will decrease the plume rise by bending the plume over more rapidly. The decrease in plume rise tends to increase the pollut-ant\u2019s ground level concentration. On the other hand, an increase in wind speed will increase the rate of dilution of the effluent plume, tending to lower the downwind con-centrations. Under different conditions, one or the other of the two wind speed effects becomes the predominant effect. These effects, in turn, affect the distance downwind of the source at which the maximum ground level concentration will occur.\nStability.  The turbulence of the atmosphere follows no other factor in power of dilu-\ntion. The more unstable the atmosphere, the greater the diluting power.

A dispersion model is a mathematical description of the meteorological transport and dispersion process that is quantified in terms of source and meteorologic parameters during a particular time. The resultant numerical calculations yield estimates of concentrations of the particular pollutant for specific locations and times. To verify the numerical results of such a model, actual measured concentrations of the particular atmospheric pollutant must be obtained and compared with the calculated values by means of statistical techniques.

In some \nmodels, provisions may be made for including lapse rate and vertical mixing height. Most models will require data about the physical stack height, the diameter of the stack at the emission discharge point, the exit gas temperature and velocity, and the mass rate of emission of pollutants. Models are usually classified as either short-term or climatological models. Short-term models are generally used under the followi"}
{"text": "ng circumstances: (1) to estimate ambient concentrations where it is impractical to sample, such as over rivers or lakes, or at great distances above the ground; (2) to estimate the required emergency source reductions associated with periods of air stagnations under air pollution episode alert conditions; and (3) to estimate the most probable locations of high, short-term, ground-level concentrations as part of a site selection evaluation for the location of air moni-toring equipment. Climatological models are used to estimate mean concentrations over a long pe-riod of time or to estimate mean concentrations that exist at particular times of the day for each season over a long period of time. Long-term models are used as an aid for developing emissions standards. We will be concerned only with short-term models in their most simple application.\nBasic Point Source Gaussian Dispersion Model.   The basic Gaussian diffusion \nequation assumes that atmospheric stability is uniform throughout the layer into which \nthe contaminated gas stream is discharged. The model assumes that turbulent diffusion is a random activity and hence the dilution of the contaminated gas stream in both the horizontal and vertical direction can be described by the Gaussian or normal equation. The model further assumes that the contaminated gas stream is released into the atmo-sphere at a distance above ground level that is equal to the physical stack height plus the plume rise (D H). The model assumes tha"}
{"text": "t the degree of dilution of the effluent \nplume is inversely proportional to the wind speed (u ). The model also assumes that \npollutant material that reaches ground level is totally reflected back into the atmo-sphere like a beam of light striking a mirror at an angle. Mathematically, this ground reflection is accounted for by assuming a virtual or imaginary source located at a dis-tance of 2 H with respect to ground level, and emitting an imaginary plume with the \nsame source strength as the real source being modeled. The same general idea can be used to establish other boundary layer conditions for the equations, such as limiting horizontal or vertical mixing.\nThe Model.  We have selected the model* equation in the form presented by D. B. \nTurner (1967). It gives the ground level concentration (x ) of pollutant at a point (co-\nordinates x and y ) downwind from a stack with an effective height ( H) (Figure 9-23). \nThe standard deviation of the plume in the horizontal and vertical directions is des-ignated by s\ny and s z, respectively. The standard deviations are functions of the \n*Note: Turner provides guidelines on the accuracy of this model.

The plume standard deviations shown in Figures 9-24 and 9-25 are based on fi  eld \nmeasurements using a 10-minute sampling time. The fi  eld measurements were \nconducted in relatively open country. Application of the equations to other settings is not recommended.\n2.  This concentration is about 0.56 ppm. Several authors have proposed rules of thumb \nto correct for the averaging time difference between the standards and the estimates provided by Equation 9-25 and the standard deviation fi  gures. These corrections \nrange from 0.33 to 0.63 for an hourly average. Using these rules, the maximum one-hour concentration would be estimated to be between 0.19 ppm and 0.35 ppm. These estimates would imply that the NAAQS one-hour standard would not be ex-ceeded. Extrapolation of the rules of thumb to longer time periods is hard to justify because the wind seldom maintains \u201ca direction\u201d for more than a few minutes.\n3.

Thus, a more realistic temperature would have been about 210\u00b0C.\nInversion Aloft.  When an inversion is present, the basic diffusion equation must be modified to take into account the fact that the plume cannot disperse vertically once it reaches the inversion layer. The plume will begin to mix downward when it reaches the base of the inversion layer (Figure 9-26). The downward mixing will begin at a dis-\ntance x\nL downwind from the stack. The x L distance is a function of the stability in the \nlayer below the inversion.

{"text": "quid must be relatively high. If water is the solute, \nthis generally limits the application to a few inorganic gases such as NH 3, Cl 2, and \nSO 2. Scrubbers are relatively inefficient absorbers but have the advantage of being \nable to simultaneously remove particulates. Towers are much more efficient absorbers but they become plugged by particulate matter. The amount of absorption that can take place for a nonreactive solution is gov-erned by the partial pressure of the pollutant. For dilute solutions, as we have in pollu-tion control systems, the relationship between partial pressure and the concentration of the gas in solution is given by Henry\u2019s law:\n P\ng5KHCequil (9-39)\nwhere Pg 5 partial pressure of gas in equilibrium with liquid, kPa\n  KH 5 Henry\u2019s law constant, kPa ? m3/g\n Cequil 5 concentration of pollutant gas in the liquid phase, g/m3\nEquation 9-39 implies that the partial pressure of the gas must increase as the liquid \naccumulates more pollutant or else it will come out of solution. Because the liquid is removing pollutant from the gas phase, this means the partial pressure is decreasing as the gas is cleaned. This is just the reverse of what we want to happen. The easiest way to get around this problem is to run the gas and liquid in opposite directions. This is called countercurrent flow. In this manner, the high concentration gas is absorbed into \na liquid with a high pollutant concentration. The lower concentration gas is absorbed by liquid with no pollutant"}

Direct flame in-\ncineration has been successfully applied to varnish-cooking, meat-smokehouse, and paint bake-oven emissions. Some catalytic materials enable oxidation to be carried out in gases that have an NHV of less than 3.7 MJ/m\n3. Conventionally, the catalyst is placed in beds similar to \nadsorption beds. Frequently, the active catalyst is a platinum or palladium compound. The supporting lattice is usually a ceramic. Aside from expense, a major drawback of the catalysts is their susceptibility to poisoning by sulfur and lead compounds in trace amounts. Catalytic combustion has successfully been applied to printing-press,  varnish-cooking, and asphalt-oxidation emissions. The fundamental problem in the design of a catalytic reactor is to determine the volume and dimensions of the catalyst bed for a given conversion and flow ra"}
{"text": "te. The catalyst increases the rate of reaction at lower temperatures than are required in direct flame incineration. The reaction is assumed to be a first-order reaction (Equation 2-14). While the reaction rate constant k  may be estimated from the Arrhenius equa-\ntion for flame incineration (Beard et al., 1980), the reaction rate constant for catalytic incineration is highly dependent on the catalyst. Thus, manufacturers\u2019 data or pilot plant data must be used to estimate the required retention time in the catalyst bed. Gas velocities in the range of 6 to 12 m/s are commonly used. Typical catalyst operating temperatures are in the range of 250\u20135508C (Noll, 1999). The actual residence time is estimated from the total gas flow rate (contaminated gas stream plus the combustion gases) at the operating temperature of the catalyst.

Spray dryer-based FGD systems consist of one or more spray dryers and a par-ticulate collector.* The reagent material is typically a slaked lime slurry or a slurry of lime and recycled material. Although lime is the most common reagent, soda ash has also been used. The reagent is injected in droplet form into the flue gas in the spray dryer. The reagent droplets absorb SO\n2 while simultaneously being dried. Ideally, the \nslurry or solution droplets are completely dried before they impact the wall of the dryer vessel. The flue gas stream becomes more humidified in the process of evapora-tion of the reagent droplets, but it does not become saturated with water vapor. This is the single most significant difference between spray dryer FGD and wet scrubber FGD. The humidified gas stream and a significant portion of the particulate matter (fly ash, FGD reaction products, and unreacted reagent) are carried by the flue gas to the particulate collector located downstream of the spray dryer vessel (Cannell and Meadows, 1985). Generally, larger units firing high-sulfur coals use wet FGD. Smaller units use spray dryers.\nControl Technologies for Nitrogen Oxides\nAlmost all nitrogen oxide (NO x) air pollution results from combustion processes. \nThey are produced from the oxidation of nitrogen bound in the fuel, from the reac-tion of molecular oxygen and nitrogen in the combustion air at temperatures above 1,600 K (see Equation 9-12), and from the reaction of"}

The processes in this category employ the fact that reduction of the peak \nflame temperature in the combustion zone reduces NO x formation. Nine alternatives \nhave been developed to reduce flame temperature: (1) minimizing operating tempera-tures, (2) fuel switching, (3) low excess air, (4) flue gas recirculation, (5) lean com-bustion, (6) staged combustion, (7) low NO\nx burners, (8) secondary combustion, and \n(9) water/steam injection.

{"text": "nverting to a fuel with \na lower nitrogen content or one that burns at a lower temperature will reduce NO x forma-\ntion. For example, petroleum coke has a lower nitrogen content and burns with a lower flame temperature than coal. On the other hand, natural gas has no nitrogen content but burns at a relatively high flame temperature and, thus, produces more NO\nx than coal.\n Low excess air and flue gas recirculation work on the principle that reduced oxygen concentrations lower the peak flame temperatures. In contrast, in lean com-bustion, additional air is introduced to cool the flame. In staged combustion and low NO\nx burners, initial combustion takes place in a \nfuel-rich zone that is followed by the injection of air downstream of the primary com-bustion zone. The downstream combustion is completed under fuel-lean conditions at a lower temperature. Staged combustion consists of injecting part of the fuel and all of the combustion air into the primary combustion zone. Thermal NO\nx production is limited by the low \nflame temperatures that result from high excess air levels. Water/steam injection reduces thermal NO\nx emissions by lowering the flame \n temperature.\nPost-Combustion.   Three processes may be used to convert NO x to nitrogen gas: \n selective catalytic reduction (SCR), selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR), and \n nonselective catalytic reduction (NSCR). The SCR process uses a catalyst bed (usually vanadium-titanium, or platinum-based and zeolite) and anhydrous ammo"}
{"text": "nia (NH\n3). After the combustion process, am-\nmonia is injected upstream of the catalyst bed. The NO x reacts with the ammonia in \nthe catalyst bed to form N 2 and water.\n In the SNCR process ammonia or urea is injected into the flue gas at an appropri-ate temperature (870 to 1,0908 C). The urea is converted to ammonia, which reacts to \nreduce the NO\nx to N 2 and water.\n NSCR uses a three-way catalyst similar to that used in automotive applications. In addition to NO\nx control, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are converted to CO 2 and \nwater. These systems require a reducing agent similar to CO and hydrocarbons up-stream of the catalyst. Larger boilers that have post combustion NO\nx controls are gen-\nerally equipped with SCR. Typical reduction capabilities of the NO\nx techniques range from 30 to 60 percent \nfor the \u201cprevention\u201d methods, 30 to 50 percent for SNCR, and 70 to 90 percent for the SCR systems (Srivastava et al., 2005).dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 661  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 661  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles662  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nParticulate Pollutants\nCyclones.

{"text": "the collection efficiency is about 95 percent.\n As the diameter of the cyclone is reduced, the efficiency of collection is increased. \nHowever, the pressure drop also increases. This increases the power requirements for moving the gas through the collector. Because an efficiency increase will result, even if the tangential velocity remains constant, the efficiency may be increased without increasing the power consumption by using multiple cyclones in parallel ( multiclones).\n From the example, you can see that cyclones are quite efficient for particles larger than 10 m m. Conversely, you should note that cyclones are not very efficient for par-\nticles 1 m m or less in diameter. Thus, they are employed only for coarse dusts. Some \napplications include controlling emissions of wood dust, paper fibers, and buffing fibers. Multiclones are frequently used as precleaners for fly-ash control devices in power plants.\nFilters.  When high efficiency control of particles smaller than 5 mm is desired, a \nfilter may be selected as the control method. Two types are in use: (1) the deep bed \nfilter, and (2) the baghouse (Figure 9-40). The deep bed filter resembles a furnace filter.

Once a dust cake begins to form on the fabric, sieving is prob-\nably the dominant mechanism. As particulate matter collects on the bag, the collection efficiency increases. The buildup of the dust cake also increases the resistance to gas\u00a0flow. At some point the pressure drop across the filter bags reduces the gas flow rate to an unacceptable level and the filter bags must be cleaned. The three methods used to clean the bags are mechanical shaking, reverse air flow, and pulse-jet cleaning. Mechanically cleaned baghouses operate by directing the dirty gas into the inside of the bag. The particulate matter is collected on the inside of the bag much in the same manner as a vacuum cleaner bag. The bags are hung on a frame that oscillates. They are shaken at periodic intervals, ranging from 30 minutes to more than 2 hours. The bags are arranged in groups in separate compartments that are taken off line during cleaning.

Extra bags, which are normally provided to compensate for the bags that are required in the other cleaning schemes, are not required in pulse-jet baghouses (Noll, 1999). Bag diameters for shaker and reverse air flow baghouses range from 15 to 45 cm. The bags may be up to 12 m in length. Pulse-jet baghouses use bags that are 10 to 15 cm in diameter with lengths less than 5 m (Noll, 1999; Wark, Warner, and Davis, 1998). The bags are made of either natural or synthetic fibers. Synthetic fibers are widely used as filtration fabrics because of their low cost, better temperature- and chemical-resistance characteristics, and small fiber diameter. Cotton fiber bags cannot be used for sustained temperatures above 908 C. Glass fiber bags, however, \ncan be used at temperatures up to 2608 C (McKenna et al., 2000). Because of the \nstress produced in cleaning, only woven fibers are used when the bags are cleaned mechanically or by reverse air flow. Felted fabrics are used in pulse-jet-cleaned baghouse (Noll, 1999). Bag life varies between 1 and 5 years. Two years is consid-ered normal. The fundamental design parameter for baghouses is the ratio of the volumetric flow rate of the gas to be cleaned to the area of filter fabric.

{"text": "t. Typical scrubbing applications include control of emission of talc dust, phosphoric acid mist, foundry cupola dust, and open hearth steel furnace fumes. Liquid scrubbers vary in complexity. Simple spray chambers are used for relatively coarse particle sizes. For high efficiency removal of fine particles, the combination of a venturi scrubber followed by a cyclone would be selected (Figure 9-41). The underlying principle of operation of the liquid scrubbers is that a differential velocity between the droplets of collecting liquid and the particulate pollutant allows the particle to impinge onto the droplet. Because the droplet-particle combination is still suspended in the gas stream, an inertial collection device is placed downstream to remove it. Because the droplet enhances the size of the particle, the collection efficiency of the inertial device is higher than it would be for the original particle without the liquid drop.

{"text": "particles. The ESP is usually constructed of alternating plates and wires (Figure 9-42). A large direct cur-rent potential (30\u201375 kV) is established between the plates and wires. This results in the creation of an ion field between the wire and plate (Figure 9-43 a). As the particle-\nladen gas stream passes between the wire and the plate, ions attach to the particles, giving them a net negative charge (Figure 9-43 b). The particles then migrate toward \nthe positively charged plate where they stick (Figure 9-43c ).

Fly ash is a generic term \nused to describe the particulate matter carried in the effluent gases from furnaces burning fossil fuels. ESPs often are used to collect fly ash. The strongest force hold-ing fly ash to the collection plate is electrostatic and is caused by the flow of current through the fly ash. The fly ash acts like a resistor and, hence, resists the flow of cur-rent. This resistance to current flow is called the resistivity of the fly ash. It is mea-sured in units of ohm ?  cm. If the resistivity is too low (less than 10\n4 ohm ? cm), not \nenough charge will be retained to produce a strong force and the particles will not \u201cstick\u201d to the plate. Conversely, and often more importantly, if the resistivity is too high (greater than 10\n10\u00a0ohm ? cm), there is an insulating effect. The layer of fly ash \nbreaks down locally and a local discharge of current ( back corona) from the nor-\nmally passive collection electrode occu"}
{"text": "rs. This discharge lowers the sparkover volt-age and produces positive ions that decrease particle charging and, hence, collection efficiency. The presence of SO\n2 in the gas stream reduces the resistivity of the fly ash. \nThis makes particle collection relatively easy. However, the mandate to reduce SO\n2 emissions has frequently been satisfied by switching to low sulfur coal. The \nresult has been increased particulate emissions. This problem can be resolved by adding conditioners such as SO\n3 or NH 3 to reduce the resistivity or by building \nlarger precipitators. Electrostatic precipitators have been used to control air pollution from electric power plants, Portland cement kilns, blast furnace gas, kilns and roasters for metal-lurgical processes, and mist from acid production facilities.\nControl Technologies for Mercury\nDuring combustion, the mercury in coal is volatilized and converted to Hg0 vapor. \nAs the flue gas cools, a series of complex reactions convert Hg0 to Hg21 and particu-\nlate Hg compounds (Hg p). The presence of chlorine favors the formation of mercuric \nchloride. In general, the majority of gaseous mercury in bituminous coal-fired boil-ers is Hg\n21. The majority of gaseous mercury in sub-bituminous- and lignite-fired \nboilers is Hg0.\n Existing boiler control equipment achieves some ancillary removal mercury com-pounds.

Dry scrubbers achieve average total mercury (particulate plus compounds) ranging from 0 to 98 percent. Wet FGD scrubber efficiencies were simi-lar. Higher efficiencies were achieved at boilers using bituminous coal than at those using sub-bituminous and lignite coal. EPA estimates that existing controls remove about 36 percent of the 75 Mg of mercury input with coal in U.S. coal-fired boilers (Srivastava et al., 2005). There are two broad approaches being developed to control mercury emissions: powdered activated carbon (PAC) injection and enhancement of existing control de-vices. The leading candidates for top efficiency (90 percent) are PAC with pulse-jet fabric filters and FGD (wet or dry) with fabric filters (U.S. EPA, 2003b).dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 673  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462dav01145_ch09_578-700.indd Page 673  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles674  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n9-11 AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OF MOBILE SOURCES\nEngine Fundamentals\nBefore we examine some cures for the pollution from the common gasoline auto \n engine, it may be useful to compare the three familiar types of engines: the gasoline engine, the diesel engine, and the jet engine.\nThe Gasoline Engine.

In the typical automobile engine with no air pollution controls, a mixture of fuel and air is fed into a cylinder and is compressed and ignited by a spark from the spark plug.

The burnt, spent mixture passes out of the engine and out through the tail pipe. As noted in Figure 9-44, a mixture of air and fuel is drawn into the cylinder. The ratio of air-to-fuel is the single most important factor in determining emissions from a four-stroke internal combustion engine. An estimate of the theoretical mass of air required to burn the fuel may be made using C\n7H13 to represent the blend of hydrocar-\nbons that we call gasoline.

Most \ndriving takes place at less than the 15-to-1 air-to-fuel ratio. Combustion is incomplete, and substantial amounts of material other than carbon dioxide and water are discharged through the tail pipe. One result of having an inadequate supply of air is the emission of carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide. Other by-products are unburned gaso-line and hydrocarbons. Because of the high temperatures and pressures that exist in the cylinder, copious amounts of NO\nx are formed (see Equation 9-12).\n The role of automobile emissions in the formation of ozone is illustrated in Figure 9-45. As the workday begins and automobiles take to the road NO concentra-\ntions increase. NO is oxidized to NO\n2, which increases in concentration while the NO \nconcentration declines.

Thus, a diesel normally operates at a higher air-to-fuel ratio than does a gasoline engine. Second, there is no spark ignition system. The air is heated by compression.

A well-designed, well-maintained, and properly adjusted diesel engine will emit less CO and hydrocarbons than the four-stroke engine because of the diesel\u2019s high air-to-fuel ratio. However, the higher operating temperatures lead to substantially higher NO\nx emissions.

Large commercial aircraft that utilize the thrust of compressed gases \nfor propulsion may contribute significant amounts of particulates and NO x to urban at-\nmospheres. Their largest emission rate is on takeoff and climb-out. However, on an an-nual basis, emissions from jet engines are small relative to those from highway vehicles. As shown in Figure 9-47, air drawn into the front of the engine is compressed and then heated by burning fuel. The expanding gas passes through turbine blades, which drive the compressor. The gas then exits the engine through an exhaust nozzle.\nEffect of Design and Operating Variables on Emissions.

In this engine the A/F ratio is as high as 25. The result is a very low emission of CO and VOCs. Coupled with a higher drive ratio, this engine also gives improved gaso"}
{"text": "line efficiency. As with all lean-burn engine modifications, this one has the drawback of higher NO formation (Cooper and Alley, 2002). Retarding the timing of the spark relative to the stroke of the piston decreases the hydrocarbon emissions by reducing the amount of unburned fuel. NO\nx emissions also \ndecrease with increased retarding. Little or no change occurs in CO emissions.\nControl of Automobile Emissions\nBlowby.  The flow of air past the moving vehicle is directed through the crankcase in\u00a0order to rid it of any gas-air mixture that has blown past the pistons, any evaporated lubricating oil, and any escaped exhaust products. The air is drawn in through a vent and emitted through a tube extending from the crankcase at a rate that depends on the speed of the car. About 20 to 40 percent of the car\u2019s total hydrocarbon emissions are sent into the atmosphere from the crankcase. These emissions are called crankcase \nblowby. All vehicles manufactured after 1963 are required to have a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve to eliminate blowby emissions.\nFuel Tank Evaporation Losses.  Evaporation of volatile hydrocarbons from the fuel \ntank is controlled by one of two systems. The simplest system is to place an activated charcoal adsorber in the tank vent line. Thus, as the gasoline expands during warm weather and forces vapor out of the vent, the HC is trapped on the activated carbon. An alternative system is to vent the tank to the crankcase. With this method, it is more d"}
{"text": "ifficult to achieve 100 percent control than with the activated charcoal system.\nEngine Exhaust.  Because engine modifications alone are not sufficient to meet strin-\ngent emission standards, an external catalytic reactor (commonly referred to as the catalytic converter) is placed on the exhaust system. The function of the catalytic con-verter is to promote reactions that convert NO\nx to N 2, CO to CO 2, and hydrocarbons to \nCO 2 and H 2O. A three-way catalyst (TWC) that simultaneously oxidizes the hydrocar-\nbons and CO and reduces the NO x is employed. The catalyst is a precious metal (for ex-\nample platinum/rhodium) on an alumina support structure. The catalyst must operate in \na narrow band of A/F ratios that is centered about the stoichiometric point (Figure 9-48). In addition, the gases entering the catalyst bed must have a specific composition and the catalyst temperature must be carefully controlled. A sophisticated computerized elec-tronic control system maintains the correct A/F and temperature (Figure 9-49). The major problems with the catalysts are their susceptibility to \u201cpoisoning\u201d by lead, phosphorus, and sulfur, and their poor wear characteristics under thermal cycling. The poisoning problem is solved by removing the lead, phosphorus, and sulfur from the fuel. Another approach being implemented is fuel modification. The use of lead in fuels was completely phased out by January 1996. In addition, diesel fuel refining is being changed so that it will contain less"}

Oxyfuel is yet another alternative. Oxyfuel is one with more oxygen to \nallow the fuel to burn more efficiently. Other alternatives include alcohols, liquified \npetroleum gas, and natural gas.\nInspection/Maintenance (I/M) Programs.   The devices installed by automobile \nmanufacturers are extremely successful in minimizing the pollution from the exhaust \nand from evaporating fuel. However, as with other aspects of running an automobile, these devices wear out and fail. Because their failure does not inhibit the operation of the automobile, they are not likely to be repaired by the owner. In those areas that have exceeded the NAAQS (nonattainment areas), inspection/maintenance programs have been implemented to ensure that the control devices are in good working order. These programs require periodic checks of the exhaust and, in some instances, the evapora-tive controls. If the vehicle fails the inspection, the owner is required to provide the required maintenance and have the vehicle reinspected. Failure to pass the inspection may be cause to deny the issua"}

Noise is an environmental  pollutant, a waste product generated in conjunction with various anthropogenic  activities. Under the latter definition, noise is any sound\u2014independent of loudness\u2014that can produce an undesired physiological or psychological effect in an individual, and that may interfere with the social ends of an individual or group. These social ends include all of our activities\u2014communication, work, rest, recreation, and sleep. As waste products of our way of life, we produce two general types of pollutants. The general public has become well aware of the first type\u2014the mass resid uals associ-ated with air and water pollution\u2014that remain in the environment for extende"}
{"text": "d periods of time. However, only recently has attention been focused on the second general type of pollution, the energy residuals such as the waste heat from manufacturing processes that creates thermal pollution of our streams. Energy in the form of sound waves con-stitutes yet another kind of energy residual, but, fortunately, one that does not remain in the environment for extended periods of time. The total amount of energy dissipated as sound throughout the earth is not large when compared with other forms of energy; it is only the extraordinary sensitivity of the ear that permits such a relatively small amount of energy to adversely affect us and other biological species. It has long been known that noise of sufficient intensity and duration can induce temporary or permanent hearing loss, ranging from slight impairment to nearly total deafness. In general, a pattern of exposure to any source of sound that produces high enough levels can result in temporary hearing loss. If the exposure persists over a pe-riod of time, this can lead to permanent hearing impairment. It has been estimated that 1.7 million workers in the United States between 50 and 59 years of age have enough hearing loss to be awarded compensation. The potential cost to U.S. industry could be in excess of $1 billion* (Olishifshi and Harford, 1975). Short-term, but frequently  serious, effects include interference with speech communication and the perception of other auditory signals, disturbance of sleep"}
{"text": " and relaxation, annoyance, interference with an individual\u2019s ability to perform complicated tasks, and general diminution of the quality of life. Beginning with the technological expansion of the Industrial Revolution and con-tinuing through a post-World War II acceleration, environmental noise in the United States and other industrialized nations has been gradually and steadily increasing, with more geographic areas becoming exposed to significant levels of noise. Where once noise levels sufficient to induce some degree of hearing loss were confined to factories and occupational situations, noise levels approaching such intensity and duration are today being recorded on city streets and, in some cases, in and around the home. There are valid reasons why widespread recognition of noise as a significant  environmental pollutant and potential hazard or, as a minimum, a detractor from the quality of life, has been slow in coming. In the first place, noise, if defined as unwanted sound, is a subjective experience. What is considered noise by one listener may be  considered desirable by another.\n*In 2005 dollars.dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 702  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 702  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesNOISE POLLUTION   703\n*In 2005 dollars.

{"text": "e environ-\nment for extended periods, as do air and water pollution. By the time the average indi-vidual is spurred to action to abate, control, or, at least, complain about sporadic environmental noise, the noise may no longer exist. Thirdly, the physiological and psychological effects of noise on us are often subtle and insidious, appearing so gradually that it becomes difficult to associate cause with effect. Indeed, to those persons whose hearing may already have been affected by noise, it may not be considered a problem at all. Further, the typical citizen is proud of this nation\u2019s technological progress and is generally happy with the things that technology delivers, such as rapid transportation, labor-saving devices, and new recreational devices. Unfortunately, many technological advances have been associated with increased environmental noise, and large segments of the population have tended to accept the additional noise as part of the price of progress. In the last three decades, the public has begun to demand that the price of prog-ress not fall to them. They have demanded that the environmental impact of noise be mitigated. The cost of mitigation is not trivial. The average cost of soundproof-ing each of 600 suburban houses around the Chicago O\u2019Hare airport was about $27,500 in 1997 (Sylvan, 2000). Through 2001, the Boston Logan airport had spent about $99 million and the Los Angeles International airport had allocated about $119 million for soundproofing and land"}
{"text": " acquisition. At the end of 2001, the total amount spent in the United States for noise mitigation exceeded $5.2 billion (de Neufville and Odoni, 2003). The cost to retrofit and replace airplanes to reduce noise probably exceeds $3.6 billion* (Achitoff, 1973). Traffic noise reduction pro-grams have been in place since the first noise barrier was built in 1963. As of 2001, departments of transportation in 44 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had constructed more than 2,900 linear kilometers of noise barriers at a cost of more than $2.8 billion* (FHWA, 2005). The engineering and scientific community has already accumulated considerable knowledge concerning noise, its effects, and its abatement and control. In that regard, noise differs from most other environmental pollutants. Generally, the technology ex-ists to control most indoor and outdoor noise. As a matter of fact, this is one instance in which knowledge of control techniques exceeds the knowledge of biological and physical effects of the pollutant.

The vibration and/or separation causes the surrounding air to undergo alternating compression and rarefaction, much in the same manner as a piston vibrating in a tube (Figure 10-1). The compression of the air molecules causes a local increase in air density and pressure. Conversely, the rarefaction causes a local decrease in density and pressure. These alternating pressure changes are the sound detected by the human ear. Let us assume that you could stand at Point A in Figure 10-1. Also let us assume that you have an instrument that will measure the air pressure every 0.000010 seconds and plot the value on a graph. If the piston vibrates at a constant rate, the condensa-tions and rarefactions will move down the tube at a constant speed. That speed is the speed of sound ( c). The rise and fall of pressure at point A will follow a cyclic or wave \npattern over a \u201cperiod\u201d of time (Figure 10-1). The wave pattern is called sinusoidal.  \nThe time between successive peaks or between successive troughs of the oscillation is called the period (P). The inverse of this, that is, the number of times a peak arrives in \none second "}

Period and frequency are then \nrelated as follows:\n P51\nf (10-1)\n Since the pressure wave moves down the tube at a constant speed, you would find \nthat the distance between equal pressure readings would remain constant.

From Figure 10-2, we can also note that \nthe average pressure could be zero if an averaging time was selected that corresponded to the period of the wave. This would result regardless of the amplitude! This, of course, is not an acceptable state of affairs.

Because our reasons for measuring noise usually involve peo-\nple, we are ultimately more interested in the human reaction to sound than in sound as a physical phenomenon. Sound pressure level, for instance, can\u2019t be taken at face value as an indication of loudness because the frequency (or pitch) of a sound has quite a bit to do with how loud it sounds. For this and other reasons, it often helps to know some-thing about the frequency of the noise you\u2019re measuring. Weighting networks are used to account for the frequency of a sound. They are electronic filtering circuits built into the meter to attenuate certain frequencies. They permit the sound level meter to respond more to some frequencies than to others with a prejudice something like that of the hu-man ear. Writers of the acoustical standards have established three weighting character-istics: A, B, and C. The chief difference among them is that very low frequencies are filtered quite  severely by the A network, moderately by the B network, and hardly at all by the C network. Therefore, if the measured sound level of"}
{"text": " a noise is much higher on C weighting than on A weighting, much of the noise is probably of low frequency. If\u00a0you really want to know the frequency distribution of a noise (and most serious noise measurers do), it is necessary to use a sound analyzer. But if you are unable to justify the expense of an analyzer, you can still find out something about the\u00a0frequency of a noise by shrewd use of the weighting networks of a sound level  meter. Figure 10-5 shows the response characteristics of the three basic networks as pre-scribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specification number S1.4\u20131971. When a weighting network is used, the sound level meter electronically subtracts or adds the number of dB shown at each frequency shown in Table 10-1 from or to the actual sound pressure level at that frequency. It then sums all the re-sultant numbers by logarithmic addition to give a single reading. Readings taken when a network is in use are said to be \u201csound levels\u201d rather than \u201csound pressure levels.\u201d The readings taken are designated in decibels in one of the following forms: dB(A); dBa; dBA; dB(B); dBb; dBB; and so on.

For the A network, the meter will subtract 19.1 dB from the actual reading, for \nthe B network, the meter will subtract 5.6 dB from the actual reading, and for the C network, the meter will subtract 0.3 dB. Thus, the anticipated readings would be:\nA network: 90 2 19.1 5 70.9 or 71 dB(A)\nB network: 90 2   5.6 5 84.4 or 84 dB(B)\nC network: 90 2   0.3 5 89.7 or 90 dB(C)\nExample 10-3.

Octave analysis is performed with a combination precision sound level meter and an octave filter set. While octave band analysis is frequently satisfactory for community noise control (that is, identifying violators), more refined analysis is required for corrective action and design.

The type A impulse is char-\nacterized by a rapid rise to a peak sound pressure level followed by a small negative pressure wave or by decay to the background level (Figure 10-7). The type B impulse is characterized by a damped (oscillatory) decay (Figure 10-8). Where the duration of the type A impulse is simply the duration of the initial peak, the duration of the type B impulse is the time required for the envelope to decay to 20 dB below the peak. Be-cause of the short duration of the impulse, a special sound-level meter must be em-ployed to measure impulse noise. You should note "}

Auditory effects include both hearing loss and speech interference. Psychological/sociological effects include annoyance, sleep interference, effects on performance, and acoustical privacy.\nThe Hearing Mechanism\nBefore we can discuss hearing loss, it is important to outline the general structure of the ear and how it works. Anatomically, the ear is separated into three sections: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear (Figure 10-9). The outer and middle ear serve to convert sound pres-sure to vibrations. In addition, they perform the protective role of keeping debris and objects from reaching the inner ear. The Eustachian tube extends from the middle ear space to the upper part of the throat behind the soft palate. The tube is normally closed.

This allows the middle ear to ventilate and equalize pressure. If external air \npressure changes rapidly, for example, by a sudden change in elevation, the tube is \nopened by involuntary swallowing or yawning to equalize the pressure.\n The sound transducer mechanism is housed in the middle ear.* It consists of the \ntympanic membrane  (eardrum) and three ossicles  (bones) (Figure 10-10). The ossicles \nare supported by ligaments and may be moved by two muscles or by deflection of the \ntympanic membrane. The muscle movement is involuntary. Loud sounds cause these \nmuscles to contract. This stiffens and diminishes the movement of the ossicular chain \n(Borg and Counter, 1989). The discussion on the middle ear that follows is excerpted \nfrom Clemis (1975).\nThe primary function of the middle ear in the hearing process is to transfer sound energy from \nthe outer to the inner ear. As the eardrum vibrates, it transfers its motion to the malleus.

Thus, the mechanical motion of the eardrum is effectively \ntransmitted through the middle ear and into the fluid of the inner ear.\nThe sound-conducting transducer amplifies sound by two main mechanisms. First, the \nlarge surface area of the drum as compared to the small surface area of the base of the stapes \n(footplate) results in a hydraulic effect. The eardrum has about 25 times as much surface area \nas the oval window. All of the sound pressure collected on the eardrum is transmitted through \nthe ossicular chain and is concentrated on the much smaller area of the oval window. This \nproduces a significant increase in pressure.\nThe bones of the ossicular chain are arranged in such a way that they act as a series of \nlevers. The long arms are nearest the eardrum, and the shorter arms are toward the oval win-\ndow. Th"}
{"text": "e fulcrums are located where the individual bones meet. A small pressure on the long \narm of the lever produces a much stronger pressure on the shorter arm. Since the longer arm is \nattached to the eardrum and the shorter arm is attached to the oval window, the ossicular chain \nacts as an amplifier of sound pressure. The magnification effect of the entire sound-conducting \nmechanism is about 22-to-1.\nThe inner ear houses both the balance receptors and the auditory receptors. The \nauditory receptors are in the cochlea.  It is a bone shaped like a snail coiled two and \none-half times around its own axis (Figure 10-9).

The scala vestibuli and the scala tympani are connected at the apex \nof the cochlea. They are filled with a fluid called perilymph,  in which the scala media \nfloats. The hearing organ, the organ of Corti,  is housed in the scala media. The scala \nmedia contains a different fluid, endolymph,  which bathes the organ of Corti.\n The scala media is triangular in shape and is about 34 mm in length.

In general, two pure tones having different frequencies but the same \nsound pressure level will be heard as different loudness levels. Loudness level is a psychoacoustic quantity. Fletcher and Munson (1935) conducted a series of experiments to determine the relationship between frequency and loudness. A reference tone and a test tone were presented alternately to the test subjects. They were asked to adjust the sound level of the test tone until it sounded as loud as the reference. The results were plotted as sound pressure level in dB versus the test tone frequency. The curves are called the Fletcher-Munson or equal loudness contours. The reference frequency is 1,000 Hz. The curves are labeled in phons, which are the sound pressure levels of the 1,000 Hz pure tone in dB. The lowest contour represents the \u201cthreshold of hearing.\u201d "}

With the exception of eardrum rupture from intense explosive noise, the outer and middle ear rarely are damaged by noise. More commonly, hearing loss is a result of neural damage involving injury to the hair cells (Figure 10-15). Two theories are offered to explain noise-induced"}
{"text": " injury. The first is that excessive shearing forces mechanically damage the hair cells. The second is that intense noise stimulation forces the hair cells into high metabolic activity, which overdrives them to the point of metabolic failure and conse-quent cell death. Once destroyed, hair cells are not capable of regeneration.\nMeasurement.  Because direct observation of the organ of Corti in persons having \npotential hearing loss is impossible, injury is inferred from losses in their HTL. The increased sound pressure level required to achieve a new HTL is called threshold shift. Obviously, any measurement of threshold shift is dependent upon having a baseline audiogram taken before the noise exposure. Hearing losses may be either temporary or permanent. Noise-induced losses must be separated from other causes of hearing loss such as age (presbycusis), drugs, dis-ease, and blows on the head. Temporary threshold shift  (TTS) is distinguished from \npermanent threshold shift (PTS) by the fact that in TTS removal of the noise over-stimulation will result in a gradual return to baseline hearing thresholds.dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 720  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 720  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesNOISE POLLUTION   721\nFactors Affecting Threshold Shift.  Important variables in the development of tem-\nporary and p"}
{"text": "ermanent hearing threshold changes include the following (NIOSH, 1972).\n 1. Sound level: Sound levels must exceed 60 to 80 dBA before the typical person \nwill experience TTS.\n 2. Frequency distribution of sound: Sounds having most of their energy in the \nspeech frequencies are more potent in causing a threshold shift than are \nsounds having most of their energy below the speech frequencies.\n 3. Duration of sound: The longer the sound lasts, the greater the amount of \nthreshold shift.\n 4. Temporal distribution of sound exposure: The number and length of quiet \nperiods between periods of sound influences the potentiality of threshold shift.\n 5. Individual differences in tolerance of sound may vary greatly among individuals.\n 6. Type of sound\u2014steady-state, intermittent, impulse, or impact: The tolerance to \npeak sound pressure is greatly reduced by increasing the duration of the sound.\nTemporary Threshold Shift (TTS).  TTS is often accompanied by a ringing in the ear, muffling of sound, or discomfort of the ears. Most of the TTS occurs during the first two hours of exposure. Recovery to the baseline HTL after TTS begins within the first hour or two after exposure. Most of the recovery that is going to be attained occurs within 16 to 24 hours after exposure.\nPermanent Threshold Shift (PTS).  There appears to be a direct relationship be-\ntween TTS and PTS. Noise levels that do not produce TTS after two to eight hours of exposure will not produce PTS if continued beyond this time. "}
{"text": "The shape of the TTS audiogram will resemble the shape of the PTS audiogram. Noise-induced hearing loss generally is first characterized by a sharply localized dip in the HTL curve at the frequencies between 3,000 and 6,000 Hz. This dip com-monly occurs at 4,000 Hz (Figure 10-16). This is the high frequency notch. The progress \nfrom TTS to PTS with continued noise exposure follows a fairly regular pattern. First, the high frequency notch broadens and spreads in both directions. While substantial losses may occur above 3,000 Hz, the individual will not notice any change in hearing. In fact, the individual will not notice any hearing loss until the speech frequencies be-tween 500 and 2,000 Hz average more than a 25 dB increase in HTL on the ANSI\u20131969 scale. The onset and progress of noise-induced permanent hearing loss is slow and insidious. The exposed individual is unlikely to notice it. Total hearing loss from noise exposure has not been observed.\nAcoustic Trauma.  The outer and middle ear rarely are damaged by intense noise. \nHowever, explosive sounds can rupture the tympanic membrane or dislocate the ossicu-lar chain. The permanent hearing loss that results from very brief exposure to a very loud noise is termed acoustic trauma (Davis, 1958).  Damage to the outer and middle \near may or may not accompany acoustic trauma.dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 721  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 721  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01"}

Although the extent and mechanisms are not clear, it ap-\npears that the structures of the middle ear offer some protection to the delicate sensory \norgans of the inner ear (Borg and Counter, 1989). One mechanism of protection is a \nchange in the mode of vibration of the stapes. As noted earlier, there is evidence that \nthe muscles of the middle ear contract reflexively in response to loud noise. This con-\ntraction results in a reduction in the amplification that this series of levers normally \nproduces. Changes in transmission may be on the order of 20 dB. However, the reac-\ntion time of the muscle/bone structure is on the order of 100\u2013200 milliseconds. Thus, \nthis protection is not effective against steep acoustic wave fronts that are characteristic \nof impact or impulsive noise.\nDamage-Risk Criteria\nA damage-risk criterion specifies the maximum allowable exposure to which a per-\nson may be exposed if risk of hearing impairment is to be avoided. The American \nAcademy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology has defined hearing impairment as \nan average HTL in excess of 25 dB (ANSI\u20131969) at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 Hz.

The Walsh-Healey \nAct, which was enacted by Congress in 1969 to protect workers, used a damage-risk \ncriterion equivalent to the line A criterion.\nSpeech Interference\nAs we all know, noise can interfere with our ability to communicate. Many noises that \nare not intense enough to cause hearing impairment can interfere with speech commu-\nnication.

Annoyance has its base in the unpleasant nature of some sounds, in the activities that are disturbed or disrupted by noise, in the physiological reactions to noise, and in the responses to the meaning of \u201cmessages\u201d carried by the noise (Miller, 1971). For example, a sound heard at night may be more an-noying than one heard by day, just as one that fluctuates may be more annoying than one that does not. A sound that resembles another sound that we already dislike and that per-haps threatens us may be especially annoying. A sound that we know is mindlessly in-flicted and will not be removed soon may be more annoying than one that is temporarily and regretfully inflicted. A sound, the source of which is visible, may be more annoying than one with an invisible source. A sound that is new may be less annoying. A sound that is locally a political issue may have a particularly high or low annoyance (May, 1978). The degree of annoyance and whether that annoyance leads to complaints, product rejection, or action against an existing or anticipated noise source depend upon many factors. Some of these factors have been identified, and their relative importance has been assessed. Responses to aircraft"}
{"text": " noise have received the greatest attention. There is less information available concerning responses to other noises, such as those of surface transportation and industry, and those from recreational activities (Miller, 1971). Many of the noise rating or forecasting systems that are now in existence were developed in an effort to predict annoyance reactions.dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 724  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 724  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesNOISE POLLUTION   725\nSonic Booms.   One noise of special interest with respect to annoyance is called sonic \nboom or, more correctly as we shall see, sonic booms.\nThe flow of air around an aircraft or other object whose speed exceeds the speed of sound \n (supersonic) is characterized by the existence of discontinuities in the air known as shock \nwave. These discontinuities result from the sudden encounter of an impenetrable body with air. At subsonic speeds, the air seems to be forewarned; thus, it begins its outward flow before the arrival of the leading edge. At supersonic speeds, however, the air in front of the aircraft is undisturbed, and the sudden impulse at the leading edge creates a region of overpressure (Figure 10-19) where the pressure is higher than atmospheric pressure. This overpressure region travels outward with the speed of sound, creating a c"}
{"text": "onically shaped shock wave called the bow wave that changes the direction of airflow. A second shock wave, the tail wave, is \nproduced by the tail of the aircraft and is associated with a region where the pressure is lower than normal. This underpressure discontinuity causes the air behind the aircraft to move sideways.\nMajor pressure changes are experienced at the ear as the bow and tail shock waves reach \nan observer. Each of these pressure deviations produces the sensation of an explosive sound  (Minnix, 1978).\n You should note that the pressure wave and, hence, the sonic boom exist whenever \nthe aircraft is at supersonic speed and not \u201cjust when it breaks the sound barrier.\u201d Both the loudness of the noise and the startling effect of the impulse (it makes us \u201cjump\u201d) are found to be very annoying. Apparently we can never get used to this kind of noise. Supersonic flight by commercial aircraft is forbidden in the airspace above the United States. Supersonic flight by military aircraft is restricted to sparsely inhab-ited areas.\nOverpressureTail wave\nBow wave\nUnderpressureSonic boom\nheard here\nSonic boom\nheard hereAtmospheric pressure\nFIGURE 10-19\nSonic booms resulting from bow wave and tail wave set in motion by \nsupersonic flight.  dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 725  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 725  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145"}
{"text": "/dav01145_pagefiles726  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nSleep Interference\nSleep interference is a special category of annoyance that has received a great deal of \nattention and study. Almost all of us have been wakened or kept from falling asleep by loud, strange, frightening, or annoying sounds. It is commonplace to be wakened by an alarm clock or clock radio. But it also appears that one can get used to sounds and sleep through them. Possibly, environmental sounds only disturb sleep when they are unfamiliar. If so, disturbance of sleep would depend only on the frequency of unusual or novel sounds. Everyday experience also suggests that sound can help to induce sleep and, perhaps, to maintain it. The soothing lullaby, the steady hum of a fan, or the rhyth-mic sound of the surf can serve to induce relaxation. Certain steady sounds can serve as an acoustical shade and mask disturbing transient sounds. Common anecdotes about sleep disturbance suggest an even greater complexity. A rural person may have difficulty sleeping in a noisy urban area. An urban person may be disturbed by the quiet when sleeping in a rural area. And how is it that a parent may wake to a slight stirring of his or her child, yet sleep through a thunderstorm? These observations all suggest that the relations between exposure to sound and the quality of a night\u2019s sleep are complicated. The effects of relatively brief noises (about three minutes or less) on a person sleeping in a quiet environment "}

A summary of some of these observations is presented in Figure 10-20. The dashed lines are hypothetical curves that represent the percent of awakenings under conditions in which the subject is a normally rested young adult male who has been adapted for several nights to the procedures of a quiet sleep laboratory. He has been instructed to press an easily reached button to indicate that he has awakened, and had been moderately motivated to awake and respond to the noise.\n80\n70605040302010\n00090\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120\ndBA\u2014Indoors-brief sounds, /H11021 3 min Percent response\n2222\n222 2\n\u201cNoise keeps me\nfrom going tosleep\u201d 30 noises\n22\n22\n2Awakeningfrom deep sleepsingle noiseAwakening overall\nsingle noiseAwakening from\nlight sleep single\nnoise\n\u201cNoise wakesme up\u201d30 noises\nFIGURE 10-20\nEffects of brief noise on sleep (Source: Miller, 1971.)  dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 726  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 726  10/25/11  11:10 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesNOISE POLLUTION   727\n While in light sleep, subjects can awake to sounds that are about 30\u201340 decibels \nabove the level at which they can be detected when subjects are conscious, alert, and attentive.

The solid lines in Figure 10-20 are data from questionnaire studies of persons who live near airports. The percentage of respondents who claim that flyovers wake them or keep them from falling asleep is plotted against the A-weighted sound level of a single flyover. These curves are for the case of approximately 30 flyovers spaced over the normal sleep period of six to eight hours. The filled circles repre-sent the percentage of sleepers that awake to a three-minute sound at each A-weighted sound level (dBA) or lower. This curve is based on data from 350 persons, each tested in his or her own bedroom. These measures were made between 2:00 and 7:00 am. It is reasonable to assume that most of the subjects were roused from a light sleep.\nEffects on Performance\nWhen a task requires the use of auditory signals, speech or nonspeech, then noise at any intensity level sufficient to mask or interfere with the perception of these signals will interfere with the performance of the task. Where mental or motor tasks do not involve auditory signals, the effects of noise on their performance have been difficult to assess. Human behavior is complicated, and it has been difficult to discover exactly how different kinds of noises might influ-ence different kinds of people doing different kinds of tasks. Nonetheless, the follow-ing"}
{"text": " general conclusions have emerged. Steady noises without special meaning do not seem to interfere with human performance unless the A-weighted noise level exceeds about 90 decibels. Irregular bursts of noise (intrusive noise) are more disruptive than steady noises. Even when the A-weighted sound levels of irregular bursts are below 90 decibels, they may sometimes interfere with performance of a task. High-frequency components of noise, above about 1,000\u20132,000 hertz, may produce more interference with performance than low-frequency components of noise. Noise does not seem to influence the overall rate of work, but high levels of noise may increase the variability of the rate of work. There may be \u201cnoise pauses\u201d followed by compensating increases in work rate. Noise is more likely to reduce the accuracy of work than to reduce the total quantity of work. Complex tasks are more likely to be adversely influenced by noise than are simple tasks.\nAcoustic Privacy\nWithout opportunity for privacy, either everyone must conform strictly to an elaborate social code or everyone must adopt highly permissive attitudes. Opportunity for privacy avoids the necessity for either extreme. In particular, without opportunity for acoustical privacy, one may experience all of the effects of noise previously described and, in addition, one is constrained because one\u2019s own activities may disturb others. Without acoustic privacy, sound, like a faulty telephone exchange, reaches the \u201cwrong  number.\u201d The r"}

In our previous discussions on loudness and annoyance, we noted that our response to sound is strongly dependent on the frequency of the sound. Fur-thermore, we noted that the type of noise (continuous, intermittent, or impulsive) and the time of day that it occurred (night being worse than day) were significant factors in annoyance. Thus, the ideal system must take frequency into account. It should differentiate between daytime and nighttime noise. And, finally, it must be capable of describing the cumulative noise exposure. A statistical system can satisfy these requirements. The practical difficulty with a statistical rating system is that it would yield a large set of parameters for each measuring location. A much larger array of numbers would be required to characterize a neighborhood. It is literally impossible for such an array of numbers to be used effectively in enforcement. Thus, there h"}
{"text": "as been a considerable effort to define a single number measure of noise exposure. The following paragraphs describe two of the systems now being used.\nThe LN Concept\nThe parameter L N is a statistical measure that indicates how frequently a particular \nsound level is exceeded. If, for example, we write L30 5 67 dBA, then we know that \n67 dB(A) was exceeded for 30 percent of the measuring time. A plot of LN against N \nwhere N 5 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, and so forth, would look like the cumula-\ntive distribution curve shown in Figure 10-21. Allied to the cumulative distribution curve is the probability distribution curve. A plot of this will show how often the noise levels fall into certain class intervals. In Figure 10-22 we can see that 35 percent of the time the measured noise levels ranged between 65 and 67 dBA; for 15 percent of the time they ranged between 67 and 69\u00a0dBA; and so on.

It is that constant noise level that, over a given time, expends the same amount of energy as the fluctuating level over the same time period. It is expressed as follows:\n \nLeq510  log  1\nt#t\n010L1t2/10 dt (10-14)\nwhere t 5 the time over which L eq is determined\n L(t) 5 the time varying noise level in dBA\n Generally speaking, there is no well-defined relationship between L(t) and \ntime, so a series of discrete samples of L (t) have to be taken. This modifies the \nexpression to: \nLeq510   log  ai5n\ni5t(10Li/10)(ti) (10-15)\nwhere n 5 the total number of samples taken\n Li 5 the noise level in dBA of the ith sample\n ti 5 fraction of total sample time\nExample 10-6.

If the sampling interval is five minutes, then the total number of samples \n(n) is 8, and the fraction of total sample time (t i) for each sample is 1/8 5 0.125. With \nthese preliminary calculations, we may now compute the sum:\n a2\nt515(1090/10)(0.250) 1(1070/10)(0.750)\n 5(2.50 3108)1(7.50 3106)52.58 3108\nAnd finally, we take the log to find\nLeq510  log  (2.58 3108)584.11, or 84, dBA\n The example calculation is depicted graphically in Figure 10-23. From this you may note that great emphasis is put on occasional high noise levels. The equivalent noise level was introduced in 1965 in Germany as a rating specifi-cally to evaluate the impact of aircraft noise upon the neighbors of airports (Burck et al., 1965). It was almost immediately recognized in Austria as appropriate for evaluating the impact of street traffic noise in dwellings and schoolrooms. It has been embodied in the National Test Standards of Germany for rating the subjective effects of fluctuat-ing noises of all kinds, such as from street and road traffic, rail traffic, canal and river ship traffic, aircraft, industrial operations (including the noise from individual ma-chines), sports stadiums, playgrounds, and the like.\nThe L dn Concept\nThe Ldn is the L eq computed over a 24-hour period with a \u201cpenalty"}

Although tire noise is much less of a problem in automobiles than in trucks, it is the dominant noise source at speeds above 80 km/h. While not as noisy as trucks, the total contribu-tion of automobiles to the noise environment is significant because of the very large number in operation. Diesel trucks are 8 to 10 dB noisier than gasoline-powered ones. At speeds above 80 km/h, tire noise often becomes the dominant noise source on the truck. The \u201ccross-bar\u201d tread is the noisiest. Motorcycle noise is highly dependent on the speed of the vehicle. The primary source of noise is the exhaust. The noise spectra of two-cycle and four-cycle engines are of somewhat different character. The two-cycle engines exhibit more high fre-quency spectra energy content.

At locations close to the source, the near field, the particle \nvelocity is not in phase with the sound pressure. In this area, Lp fluctuates with distance \nand does not follow the inverse square law. When the particle velocity and sound pres-sure are in phase, the location of the sound measurement is said to be in the far field.

The shaded area in the \nfar field of Figure 10-29 shows that L\np does not follow the inverse square law in the \nreverberant field.\nDirectivity\nMost real sources do not radiate sound uniformly in all directions. If you were to mea-sure the sound pressure level in a given frequency band at a fixed distance from a real source, you would find different levels for different directions. If you plotted these data in polar coordinates, you would obtain the directivity pattern of the source. The directivity factor is the numerical measure of the directivity of a sound source. \nIn logarithmic form the directivity factor is called the directivity index.

That is, the intensity at a radius, r, is twice as large if a source radi-ates into a hemisphere rather than the ideal sphere we have used up to this point. Each directivity index is applicable only to the angle at which L\npu was measured and only \nfor the frequency at which it was measured.

As the  temperature increases to about 10 to 20 8C (depending upon the noise frequency), \nabsorption increases. Above 25 8C, absorption decreases. Sound absorption is higher \nat higher frequencies. The vertical temperature profile greatly alters the propagation paths of sound. If a superadiabatic lapse rate exists, sound rays bend upward and noise shadow zones are formed (Figure 10-30b ). If an inversion exists, sound rays are bent back toward the \nground (Figure 10-30 a). This results in an increase in the sound level. These effects are \nnegligible for short distances but may exceed 20 dB at distances over 800 m. In a similar fashion, wind speed gradients alter the way noise propagates. Sound traveling with the wind is bent down, while sound traveling against the wind is bent upward. When sound waves are bent down, there is little or no increase in sound lev-els. But when sound waves are bent upward, there can be a noticeable reduction in sound levels.\nBasic Point Source Model.  A point source is one for which kd , , 1 and for which \nEquation 10-18 holds.

These documents \nhave been used widely because of their simplicity and relatively high success in mak-ing accurate noise predictions. The NCHRP 174 procedure is the last revision in the series. It contains a four-step procedure for the prediction and control of highway noise. We have limited ourselves to the first prediction step, that is, the \u201cshort method.\u201d The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed sophisticated computer models to replace the NCHRP 174 manual technique used in this text for  illustration purposes. The FHWA released Version 2.5 of the Traffic Noise Model\u2014TNM in 2004.* The objective of the \u201cshort method\u201d is to obtain a quick and gross (always overpredicting) prediction of the expected noise levels. This is necessary because the prediction of true highway noise levels is a rather complicated subject. In many instances it is desirable to first obtain a rough idea of the potential problem areas before full knowledge of the ho"}
{"text": "rizontal and vertical roadway design parameters has been gained. Such is the case, for example, of a location study where a number of alignments must be considered. Also, this first step helps to eliminate areas that do not represent a problem in terms of noise levels, thus simplifying further evaluation. The \u201cshort method\u201d prediction can be performed quickly through use of two nomographs and knowledge of a few traffic and roadway parameters. \u2020 By its design, \nthe \u201cshort method\u201d requires many assumptions and approximations and should not be used as a final tool. The second step (the \u201ccomplete method\u201d) utilizes a microcomputer program to refine the predictions made in the first step. The third step is the selection of a noise control design. The fourth step is to redo the second step and check the design solution. In the following paragraphs we have reproduced the short method as it appears in NCHRP 174, with the addition of clarifying comments and modification to SI units.\nMethodology.  The flow diagram that illustrates the methodology of the short \nmethod is shown in Figure 10-33. The method assumes that the roadway can be ap-proximated by one infinite element with constant traffic parameters and roadway characteristics. The initial step in using the short method consists of defining an infinite straight-line approximation to the real highway configuration.

The procedure is as follows: Determine the barrier parameters and enter on lines 5 through 8 of the NPWS. Use Figure 10-36 for definitions of parameters. The parameters that must be measured are: (a ) line-of-sight distance, L/S , (b) break in line \nof sight, (c ) barrier position distance, and (d ) angle subtended, u  (degree). \nThe angle subtended is measured from the ends of the barrier with respect to the position of the observer. For an observer placed equidistant from the ends of the barrier, the angle may be determined from simple trigonometric principles. Graphical methods may be more appropriate for other configu-rations. Note that as the barrier length increases, the angle approaches 180\u00a0degrees.\n 5.

Because the automobile noise is as-sumed to originate at an elevation of 0.0 m, the \u201cBreak in Barrier\u201d is greater than for the heavy trucks, where the noise is asssumed to originate at an elevation of 2.44 m.\nUsing the barrier nomograph shown in Figure 10-38, proceed as follows:\n 1. Starting from the vertical L/S  scale on the left: From the 60-m point on the \nL/S scale, draw a straight line going through the 4.6-m point on the \u201cBreak \nin barrier\u201d to the \u201cTurn line.\u201d Note that the scale is logarithmic.

Finally, draw a vertical line from E upward until it intersects the barrier \nattenuation scale. The attenuation can now be read, that is, 13 dBA for automobiles and medium trucks.\nThe same procedure is followed for heavy trucks using 2.6 m for the \u201cBreak in Barrier\u201d because of the higher noise emission elevation from the heavy trucks. Note from Figure 10-36 that this distance is perpendicular to L/S and not perpendicular to the horizontal. The attenuation is about 10 dBA.\nThe revised overall combined L\n10 would then be 60 dBA.

Noise also \ntravels along structural paths. Noise can travel from one point to another via any one path or a combination of several paths. Noise from a washing machine operating in one apartment may be transmitted to another apartment along air passages such as open windows, doorways, corridors, or duct work. Direct physical contact of the wash-ing machine with the floor or walls sets these building components into vibration. This vibration is transmitted structurally throughout the building, causing walls in other areas to vibrate and to radiate noise. The receiver may be, for example, a single person, a classroom of students, or a suburban community. Solution of a given noise problem might require alteration or modification of "}

Altering or controlling the transmission path and the environment to reduce \nthe noise level reaching the listener\n 3. Providing the receiver with personal protective equipment\nControl of Noise Source by Design\nReduce Impact Forces.  Many machines and items of equipment are designed with \nparts that strike forcefully against other parts, producing noise. Often, this striking action or impact is essential to the machine\u2019s function. A familiar example is the typewriter\u2014its keys must strike the ribbon and paper in order to leave an inked impression. But the force of the key also produces noise as the impact falls on the ribbon, paper, and platen. Several steps can be taken to reduce noise from impact forces. The particular remedy to be applied will be determined by the nature of the machine in question. Not all of the steps listed below are practical for every machine and for every impact-produced noise. But application of even one suggested measure can often reduce the noise appreciably. Some of the more obvious design modifications are as follows:\n 1. Reduce the weight, size, or height of fall of the impacting mass.\n 2. Cushion the impact by inserting a layer of shock-absorbing material between \nthe impacting surfaces. (For example, insert several sheets of paper in the \ntypewriter behind the top sheet to absorb some of the noise-producing impact of the keys.) In some situations, "}
{"text": "you could insert a layer of shock-absorbing material behind each of the impacting heads or objects to reduce the transmis-sion of impact energy to other parts of the machine.\n 3. Whenever practical, one of the impact heads or surfaces should be made of \nnonmetallic material to reduce resonance (ringing) of the heads.\n 4. Substitute the application of a small impact force over a long time period for \na large force over a short period to achieve the same result.\n 5. Smooth out acceleration of moving parts by applying accelerating forces \ngradually. Avoid high, jerky acceleration or jerky motion.dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 758  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 758  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesNOISE POLLUTION   759\n 6. Minimize overshoot, backlash, and loose play in cams, followers, gears, link-\nages, and other parts. This can be achieved by reducing the operational speed \nof the machine, better adjustment, or by using spring-loaded restraints or guides. Machines that are well made, with parts machined to close tolerances, generally produce a minimum of such impact noise.\nReduce Speeds and Pressures.

{"text": "on systems lessens turbulence, resulting in decreased noise radiation. Some specific sug-gestions that may be incorporated in design are the following:\n 1. Fans, impellers, rotors, turbines, and blowers should be operated at the lowest \nbladetip speeds that will still meet job needs. Use large-diameter, low-speed \nfans rather than small-diameter, high-speed units for quiet operation. In short, maximize diameter and minimize tip speed.\n 2. All other factors being equal, centrifugal squirrel-cage type fans are less noisy \nthan vane axial or propeller type fans.\n 3. In air ventilation systems, a 50 percent reduction in the speed of the air flow \nmay lower the noise output by 10 to 20 dB, or roughly one-quarter to one-half of the original loudness. Air speeds less than 3 m/s measured at a supply or return grille produce a level of noise that usually is unnoticeable in residential or office areas. In a given system, reduction of air speed can be achieved by operating at lower motor or blower speeds, installing a greater number of ventilating grilles, or increasing the cross-sectional area of the existing grilles.\nReduce Frictional Resistance.  Reducing friction between rotating, sliding, or mov-ing parts in mechanical systems frequently results in smoother operation and lower noise output. Similarly, reducing flow resistance in fluid distribution systems results in less noise radiation. Four of the more important factors that should be checked to reduce frictional re-sistance in m"}

Good axial and directional alignment in pulley sys-\ntems, gear trains, shaft couplings, power transmission systems, and bearing and axle alignment are fundamental requirements for low noise output.\n 2. Polish: Highly polished and smooth surfaces between sliding, meshing, or \ncontacting parts are required for quiet operation, particularly where bearings, gears, cams, rails, and guides are concerned.\n 3. Balance: Static and dynamic balancing of rotating parts reduces frictional re-\nsistance and vibration, resulting in lower noise output.\n 4. Eccentricity (out-of-roundness): Off-centering of rotating parts such as pul-\nleys, gears, rotors, and shaft/bearing alignment causes vibration and noise. dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 759  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 759  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles760  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nLikewise, out-of-roundness of wheels, rollers, and gears causes uneven wear, \nresulting in flat spots that generate vibration and noise.\n The key to effective noise control in fluid systems is streamline flow. This holds true regardless of whether one is concerned with air flow in ducts or vacuum cleaners, or with water flow in plumbing systems."}
{"text": " Streamline flow is simply smooth, nonturbu-lent, low-friction flow. The two most important factors that determine whether flow will be streamline or turbulent are the speed of the fluid and the cross-sectional area of the flow path, that is, the pipe or duct diameter. The rule of thumb for quiet operation is to use a low-speed, large-diameter system to meet a specified flow capacity requirement. However, even such a system can inadvertently generate noise if certain aerodynamic design features are overlooked or ignored. A system designed for quiet operation will employ the fol-lowing features:\n 1. Low fluid speed: Low fluid speeds avoid turbulence, which is one of the main \ncauses of noise.\n 2. Smooth boundary surfaces: Duct or pipe systems with smooth interior walls, \nedges, and joints generate less turbulence and noise than systems with rough \nor jagged walls or joints.\n 3. Simple layout: A well-designed duct or pipe system with a minimum of \nbranches, turns, fittings, and connectors is substantially less noisy than a com-plicated layout.\n 4. Long-radius turns: Changes in flow direction should be made gradually and \nsmoothly. It has been suggested that turns should be made with a curve radius equal to about five times the pipe diameter or major cross-sectional dimension of the duct.\n 5. Flared sections: Flaring of intake and exhaust openings, particularly in a duct \nsystem, tends to reduce flow speeds at these locations, often with substantial reductions in noise output.\n "}
{"text": "6. Streamline transition in flow path: Changes in flow path dimensions or cross-\nsectional areas should be made gradually and smoothly with tapered or flared transition sections to avoid turbulence. A good rule of thumb is to keep the cross-sectional area of the flow path as large and as uniform as possible throughout the system.\n 7. Remove unnecessary obstacles: The greater the number of obstacles in the \nflow path, the more tortuous, turbulent, and hence noisier, the flow. All other required and functional devices in the path, such as structural supports, de-flectors, and control dampers, should be made as small and as streamlined as possible to smooth out the flow patterns.\nReduce Radiating Area.  Generally speaking, the larger the vibrating part or surface, the greater the noise output. The rule of thumb for quiet machine design is to minimize the effective radiating surface areas of the parts without impairing their operation or dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 760  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 760  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesNOISE POLLUTION   761\nstructural strength. This can be done by making parts smaller, removing excess mate-\nrial, or by cutting openings, slots, or perforations in the parts.

In many cases, machine cabinets can be made into rather \neffective soundproof enclosures through simple design changes and the application of \nsome sound-absorbing treatment. Substantial reductions in noise output may be achieved by adopting some of the following recommendations:\n 1. All unnecessary holes or cracks, particularly at joints, should be caulked.\n 2. All electrical or plumbing penetrations of the housing or cabinet should be \nsealed with rubber gaskets or a suitable nonsetting caulk.\n 3. If practical, all other functional or required openings or ports that radiate \nnoise should be covered with lids or shields edged with soft rubber gaskets to \neffect an airtight seal.\n 4. Other openings required for exhaust, cooling, or ventilation purposes should \nbe equipped with mufflers or acoustically lined ducts.\n 5. Openings should be directed away from the operator and other people.\nIsolate and Dampen Vibrating Elements.  In all but the simplest machines, the vi-brational energy from a specific moving part is transmitted through the machine struc-ture, forcing other component parts and surfaces to vibrate and radiate sound\u2014often with greater intensity than that generated by the originating source itself. Generally, vibration problems can be considered in two parts. First, we must pre-vent energy transmission between the sourc"}
{"text": "e and surfaces that radiate the energy. Sec-ond, we must dissipate or attenuate the energy somewhere in the structure. The first part of the problem is solved by isolation. The second part is solved by damping. The most effective method of vibration isolation involves the resilient mounting of the vibrating component on the most massive and structurally rigid part of the ma-chine. All attachments or connections to the vibrating part, in the form of pipes, con-duits, and shaft couplers, must be made with flexible or resilient connectors or couplers. For example, pipe connections to a pump that is resiliently mounted on the structural frame of a machine should be made of resilient tubing and be mounted as close to the pump as possible. Resilient pipe supports or hangers may also be required to avoid bypassing the isolated system (Figure 10-39). Damping material or structures are those that have some viscous properties. They tend to bend or distort slightly, thus consuming part of the noise energy in molecular motion. The use of spring mounts on motors and laminated galvanized steel and plas-tic in air-conditioning ducts are two examples. When the vibrating noise source is not amenable to isolation, as, for example, in ventilation ducts, cabinet panels, and covers, then damping materials can be used to  reduce the noise.dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 761  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 761  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_d"}

Generally speaking, the following guidelines should be observed in the se-lection and use of such materials to maximize vibration damping efficiency:\n 1. Damping materials should be applied to those sections of a vibrating surface \nwhere the most flexing, bending, or motion occurs. These usually are the \nthinnest sections.\n 2. For a single layer of damping material, the stiffness and mass of the material \nshould be comparable to that of the vibrating surface to which it is applied. This means that single-layer damping materials should be about two or three times as thick as the vibrating surface to which they are applied.\n 3. Sandwich materials (laminates) made up of metal sheets bonded to mastic (sheet \nmetal viscoelastic composites) are much more effective vibration dampers than single-layer materials; the thickness of the sheet-metal constraining layer and the viscoelastic layer should each be about one-third the thickness of the vibrating surface to which they are applied. Ducts and panels can be purchased already fabricated as laminates.\nMachine\nchassis\nFIGURE 10-39\nExamples of vibration isolation.\nCode:\n1.  Motors, pumps, and fans installe"}

There is no real distinction between mufflers and si-\nlencers. They are often used interchangeably. They are, in effect, acoustical filters and are used when fluid flow noise is to be reduced. The devices can be classified into two fundamental groups: absorptive mufflers and reactive mufflers. An absorptive muffler is one whose noise reduction is determined mainly by the presence of fibrous or porous materials, which absorb the sound. A reactive muffler is one whose noise reduction is determined mainly by geometry. It is shaped to reflect or expand the sound waves with resultant self-destr"}
{"text": "uction. Although there are several terms used to describe the performance of mufflers, the most frequently used appears to be insertion loss  (IL). Insertion loss is the difference \nbetween two sound pressure levels that are measured at the same point in space before and after a muffler has been inserted. Because each muffler\u2019s IL is highly dependent on the manufacturer\u2019s selection of materials and configuration, we will not present general IL prediction equations.\nNoise Control in the Transmission Path\nAfter you have tried all possible ways of controlling the noise at the source, your next line of defense is to set up devices in the transmission path to block or reduce the flow of sound energy before it reaches your ears. This can be done in several ways: (a) ab-sorb the sound along the path, (b) deflect the sound in some other direction by placing a reflecting barrier in its path, or ( c) contain the sound by placing the source inside a \nsound-insulating box or enclosure. Selection of the most effective technique will depend upon various factors, such as the size and type of source, intensity and frequency range of the noise, and the nature and type of environment.\nSeparation.  We can make use of the absorptive capacity of the atmosphere, as well \nas divergence, as a simple, economical method of reducing the noise level. Air absorbs high-frequency sounds more effectively than it absorbs low-frequency sounds. How-ever, if enough distance is available, even low-frequency soun"}
{"text": "ds will be absorbed ap-preciably. If you can double your distance from a point source, you will have succeeded in lowering the sound pressure level by 6 dB. It takes about a 10 dB drop to halve the loudness. If you have to contend with a line source such as a railroad train, the noise level drops by only 3 dB for each doubling of distance from the source. The main rea-son for this lower rate of attenuation is that line sources radiate sound waves that are cylindrical in shape. The surface area of such waves only increases two-fold for each doubling of distance from the source. However, when the distance from the train be-comes comparable to its length, the noise level will begin to drop at a rate of 6 dB for each subsequent doubling of distance. Indoors, the noise level generally drops only from 3 to 5 dB for each doubling of distance in the near vicinity of the source. However, further from the source, reductions of only 1 or 2 dB occur for each doubling of distance due to the reflections of sound off hard walls and ceiling surfaces.dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 763  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 763  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles764  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nAbsorbing Materials.   Noise, like light, will bounce from one hard surface to an-\nother. In noise control work, this is called reverberat"}
{"text": "ion. If a soft, spongy material is \nplaced on the walls, floors, and ceiling, the reflected sound will be diffused and soaked up (absorbed). Sound-absorbing materials are rated either by their Sabin absorption coefficients ( a\nSAB) at 125, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz or by a single number rat-\ning called the noise reduction coefficient (NRC). If a unit area of open window is as-sumed to transmit all and reflect none of the acoustical energy that reaches it, it is assumed to be 100 percent absorbent. This unit area of totally absorbent surface is called a \u201csabin\u201d (Sabin, 1942). The absorptive properties of acoustical materials are then compared with this standard. The performance is expressed as a fraction or per-centage of the sabin ( a\nSAB). The NRC is the average of the aSABs at 250, 500, 1,000, \nand 2,000 Hz rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.05. The NRC has no physical mean-ing. It is a useful means of comparing similar materials. Sound-absorbing materials such as acoustical tile, carpets, and drapes placed on ceiling, floor, or wall surfaces can reduce the noise level in most rooms by about 5 to 10 dB for high-frequency sounds, but only by 2 or 3 dB for low-frequency sounds. Unfortunately, such treatment provides no protection to an operator of a noisy machine who is in the midst of the direct noise field. For greatest effectiveness, sound-absorbing materials should be installed as close to the noise source as possible. If you have a small or limited amount of soun"}
{"text": "d-absorbing material and wish to make the most effective use of it in a noisy room, the best place to put it is in the upper trihedral corners of the room, formed by the ceiling and two walls. Due to the process of reflection, the concentration of sound is greatest in the trihedral corners of a room. Additionally, the upper corner locations also protect the lightweight fragile materials from damage. Because of their light weight and porous nature, acoustical materials are ineffec-tual in preventing the transmission of either airborne or structure-borne sound from one room to another. In other words, if you can hear people walking or talking in the room or apartment above, installing acoustical tile on your ceiling will not reduce the noise transmission.\nAcoustical Lining.  Noise transmitted through ducts, pipe chases, or electrical chan-\nnels can be reduced effectively by lining the inside surfaces of such passageways with sound-absorbing materials. In typical duct installations, noise reductions on the order of 10 dB/m for an acoustical lining 2.5 cm thick are well within reason for high- frequency noise. A comparable degree of noise reduction for the lower frequency sounds is considerably more difficult to achieve because it usually requires at least a doubling of the thickness and/or length of acoustical treatment.\nBarriers and Panels.   Placing barriers, screens, or deflectors in the noise path can be \nan effective way of reducing noise transmission, provided that the bar"}

The effectiveness of a barrier depends on its location, its height, and its length. Referring to Figure 10-40, we can see that the noise can follow five different paths.dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 764  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 764  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesNOISE POLLUTION   765\n First, the noise follows a direct path to receivers who can see the source well over \nthe top of the barrier. The barrier does not block their line of sight ( L/S) and therefore \nprovides no attenuation. No matter how absorptive the barrier is, it cannot pull the \nsound downward and absorb it.\n Second, the noise follows a diffracted path to receivers in the shadow zone of the \nbarrier. The noise that passes just over the top edge of the barrier is diffracted (bent) \ndown into the apparent shadow shown in the figure. The larger the angle of diffraction, \nthe more the barrier attenuates the noise in this shadow zone. In other words, less en-\nergy is diffracted through large angles than through smaller angles.\n Third, in the shadow zone, the noise transmitted directly through the barrier may \nbe significant in some cases. For example, with extremely la"}
{"text": "rge angles of diffraction, \nthe diffracted noise may be less than the transmitted noise. In this case, the transmitted \nnoise compromises the performance of the barrier. It can be reduced by constructing a \nheavier barrier. The allowable amount of transmitted noise depends on the total barrier \nattenuation desired. More is said about this transmitted noise later.\n The fourth path shown in Figure 10-40 is the reflected path. After reflection, the \nnoise is of concern only to a receiver on the opposite side of the source. For this rea-\nson, acoustical absorption on the face of the barrier may sometimes be considered to \nreduce this reflected noise; however, this treatment will not benefit any receivers in the \nshadow zone. It should be noted that in most practical cases the reflected noise does \nnot play an important role in barrier design. If the source of noise is represented by a \nline of noise, another short-circuit path is possible. Part of the source may be un-\nshielded by the barrier. For example, the receiver might see the source beyond the ends \nof the barrier if the barrier is not long enough. This noise from around the ends may \ncompromise, or short-circuit, barrier attenuation. The required barrier length depends \non the total net attenuation desired. When 10 to 15 dB attenuation is desired, barriers \nmust, in general, be very long. Therefore, to be effective, barriers must not only break \nthe line of sight to the nearest section of the source, but also to the sourc"}

The procedures presented in the \nbarrier nomograph used to predict highway noise are based on this concept. Another general principle of barrier noise reduction that is worth reviewing at this point is the relation between noise attenuation expressed in (1) decibels, (2) energy terms, and (3) subjective loudness. Table 10-10 gives these relationships for line sources. As indicated in the loudness column, a barrier attenuation of 3 dB will be barely discerned by the receiver. However, to attain this reduction, 50 percent of the acoustical energy must be removed. To cut the loudness of the source in half, a reduc-tion of 10 dB is necessary. That is equivalent to eliminating 90 percent of the energy initially directed toward the receiver. A"}
{"text": "s indicated previously, this drastic reduction in energy requires very long and high barriers. In summary, when designing barriers, you can expect the complexity of the design to be about as follows:\nAttenuation (dB) Complexity\n  5 Simple\n 10 Attainable 15 Very difficult 20 Nearly impossible\n Roadside barriers can be designed using the barrier nomograph in reverse order. A \nset of typical solutions is summarized in Table 10-11. The noise reduction at 152 m is less than that at 30 m because the barrier does not cast as large a shadow at a distance. The effectiveness of the barrier is reduced for trucks because of the elevated nature of the source.\nTransmission Loss.  When the position of the noise source is very close to the bar-\nrier, the diffracted noise is less important than the transmitted noise. If the barrier is in fact a wall panel that is sealed at the edges, the transmitted noise is the only one of  concern.TABLE 10-10\nRelation between sound level reduction, energy, and loudness for line sources\n To reduce A-level  Remove portion  Divide loudness \n by dB of energy (%) by\n 3 50   1.2\n 6 75   1.5\n 10 90   2\n 20 90   4\n 30 99.9  8\n 40 99.99 16\n(Source: Kugler et al., 1976.)dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 766  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch10_701-784.indd Page 766  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesNOISE POLLUTION   767\n The ratio of t"}
{"text": "he sound energy incident on one surface of a panel to the energy \nradiated from the opposite surface is called the sound transmission loss (TL). The actual energy loss is partially reflected and partially absorbed. Since TL is frequency-dependent, only a complete octave or one-third octave band curve provides a full description of the performance of the barrier.\nEnclosures.  Sometimes it is much more practical and economical to enclose a \nnoisy machine in a separate room or box than to quiet it by altering its design, op-eration, or component parts. The walls of the enclosure should be massive and air-tight to contain the sound. Absorbent lining on the interior surfaces of the enclosure will reduce the reverberant buildup of noise within it. Structural contact between the noise source and the enclosure must be avoided, so that the source vibration is not transmitted to the enclosure walls, thus short-circuiting the isolation. For maxi-mum effective noise control, all of the techniques illustrated in Figure 10-41 must be employed.Highway configurationaTABLE 10-11\nNoise reductions for various highway configurations\n      Noise\n      reductionb at\n   Height   distance from\n   or Truck  ROW (dBA)\n   depth  mix\n Sketch Description (m) (%)  30 m          152 m\n  Roadside barriers 6.1  0 13.9 13.3\n  7.6 m from edge   5 13.0 12.1\n  of shoulders;  10 12.6 11.7\n  ROW 5 78 m wide  20 12.3 11.3\n  Depressed roadway 6.1  0  9.9 11.4\n  w/2:1 slopes;   5  8.8 10.3\n  ROW 5 102 m  10  8.4  9.8"}

However, we \nare frequently faced with an existing source that, either because of age, abuse, or poor design, is a noise problem. The result is that we must redress, or correct, the problem as it currently exists. The following sections identify some measures that might apply if you are allowed to tinker with the source.\nBalance Rotating Parts.  One of the main sources of machinery noise is structural vi-\nbration caused by the rotation of poorly balanced parts, such as fans, fly wheels, pulleys, cams, shafts, and so on. Measures used to correct this condition involve the addition of counterweights to the rotating unit or the removal of some weight from the unit. You are probably familiar with noise caused by imbalance in the hi"}
{"text": "gh-speed spin cycle of washing machines. The imbalance results from clothes not being distributed evenly in the tub. By redistributing the clothes, balance is achieved and the noise ceases. This same principle of balance can be applied to furnace fans and other common sources of such noise.\nReduce Frictional Resistance.   A well-designed machine that has been poorly main-\ntained can become a serious source of noise. General cleaning and lubrication of all \nrotating, sliding, or meshing parts at contact points should go a long way toward fixing the problem.\nApply Damping Materials.  Because a vibrating body or surface radiates noise, the \napplication of any material that reduces or restrains the vibrational motion of that body will decrease its noise output. Three basic types of redress vibration damping materials are available:\n 1. Liquid mastics, which are applied with a spray gun and harden into relatively \nsolid materials, the most common being automobile \u201cundercoating\u201d\nInstall double wall for\noptimum sound isolationAcoustical lining\nreduces noise\nbuildup\nSolid wall construction\nInstall lined ducts if\nventilation or cooling\nis neededAvoid structural\ncontact between\nwalls\nAir flow\nIsolate source\nfrom enclosure\nSpring\nmountAirtight seal needed\nto preserve isolation\nFIGURE 10-41\nEnclosures for controlling noise.

Small holes in an otherwise noise-tight structure can reduce the \neffectiveness of the noise control measures. As you can see in Figure 10-42, if the designed transmission loss of an acoustical enclosure is 40 dB, an opening that com-prises only 0.1 percent of the surface area will reduce the effectiveness of the enclosure by 10 dB.\nPerform Routine Maintenance.   We all recognize the noise of a worn muffler. Like-\nwise, studies of automobile tire noise in relation to pavement roughness show that \nmaintenance of the pavement surface is essential to keep noise at minimum levels.

When exposure to intense noise fields is required and none of \nthe measures discussed so far is practical, as, for example, for the operator of a chain saw or pavement breaker, then measures must be taken to protect the receiver. The fol-lowing two techniques are commonly employed.\nAlter Work Schedule.  Limit the amount of continuous exposure to high noise lev-\nels. In terms of hearing protection, it is preferable to schedule an intensely noisy op-eration for a short interval of time each day over a period of several days rather than a continuous eight-hour run for a day or two. In industrial or construction operations, an intermittent work schedule would ben-efit not only the operator of the noisy equipment, but also other workers in the vicinity. If an intermittent schedule is not possible, then workers should be given relief time during the day. They should take their relief time at a low-noise-level location, and should be discouraged from trading relief time for dollars, paid vacation, or an \u201cearly out\u201d at the end of the day! Inherently noisy operations, such as street repair, municipal trash collection, fac-tory operation, and aircraft traffic, should be curtailed at night and early morning to avoid disturbing the sleep of the community. Remember: operations between 10 p.m"}

Molded and pliable earplugs, cup-type protectors, and helmets are \ncommercially available as hearing protectors. Such devices may provide noise reduc-\ntions ranging from 15 to 35 dB (Figure 10-43).

These devices should be used only as a last resort, after all other methods have failed to lower the noise level to acceptable limits.

It includes \nthings we commonly describe as garbage, refuse, and trash. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) regulatory definition is broader in scope. It includes any discarded item; things destined for reuse, recycle, or reclamation; sludges; and hazard-ous wastes. The regulatory definition specifically excludes radioactive wastes and in \nsitu mining wastes. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the fed-eral act that regulates the disposal of solid waste. The act has two subtitles that have become a shorthand means of identifying the type of solid waste. \u201cSubtitle C\u201d wastes are hazardous wastes. \u201cSubtitle D"}
{"text": "\u201d wastes are all other solid wastes that are not haz-ardous or radioactive. We have limited the discussion in this chapter to solid wastes generated from residential and commercial sources. Sludges were discussed in Chapters 6 and 8. Hazardous waste will be discussed in Chapter 12, and radioactive waste will be dis-cussed in Chapter 14, which can be found at the text\u2019s website: www.mhhe.com/davis.\nMagnitude of the Problem\nSolid waste disposal creates a problem primarily in highly populated areas. The more concentrated the population, the greater the problem becomes. Various estimates have been made of the quantity of solid waste generated and collected per person per day. In 2009, the EPA estimated that the national average rate of solid waste generated was 2.0 kg/capita ? day (U.S. EPA, 2010). On this basis, in 2009, the U.S. produced \n221 teragrams (Tg) of solid waste.* This is a 60 percent increase over the 1980 estimate \nof 137.8 Tg and a nearly 175 percent increase over the 1960 estimate of 80.1 Tg. The EPA estimates that between 55 and 65 percent of the waste stream comes from resi-dential sources, and the remainder is from commercial sources. Individual cities may vary greatly from these estimates. For example, Los Angeles, California, generates about 3.18 kg/capita ? day while the rural community of Wilson, Wisconsin, generates about 1.0 kg/capita ? day. Figure 11-1 shows solid waste production rates. Averages are subject to adjustment depending on many local factors."}
{"text": " Studies show there are wide differences in amounts collected by municipalities because of differences in climate, living standards, time of year, education, location, and collection and disposal practices.\nRecycling Trends in Waste Management\nWhile the amount of solid waste produced in the United States has increased, the recycling rate has also increased. In 1980, less than 10 percent of the solid waste pro-duced was recycled. In 2009, the percentage of waste recycled increased to 34 percent. An additional 12 percent of the solid waste produced in 2009 was combusted with energy recovery, resulting in 54 percent of the solid waste generated in the United States in 2009 discarded in landfills. Therefore, although the amount of solid waste \n*In keeping with correct SI notation, we use teragrams (1 3  1012 grams). One Tg is equivalent to 1 3  109 kilo-\ngrams (kg) or 1 3 106 megagrams (Mg).

Large percentages of aluminum and steel cans, yard trimmings, tires, and glass containers were also recycled.\nCharacteristics of Solid Waste\nThe terms refuse and solid waste are used more or less synonymously, although the lat-ter term is preferred. The common materials of solid waste can be classified in several different ways. The point of origin is important in some cases, so classification as do-mestic, institutional, commercial, industrial, street, demolition, or construction may be useful. The nature of the material may be important, so classification can be made on the basis of organic, inorganic, combustible, noncombustible, putrescible, and nonpu-trescible fractions. One of the most useful classifications is based on the kinds of mate-rials as shown in Table 11-1. Another classification system that is similar to this is the one used by the Incinerator Institute of America (Table 11-2). This is based primarily on the heat content of the waste. Garbage is the animal and vegetable waste resulting from the handling, prepara-\ntion, cooking, and serving of food. It is composed largely of putrescible organic matter and moisture; it includes a minimum of free liquids. The term does not include food processing wastes from canneries, slaughterhouses, packing plants, and similar facili-ties, or"}

The density of loose combustible refuse is approximately 115 kg/m\n3, while the \ndensity of collected solid waste is 235 to 300 kg/m3.\nSolid Waste Management Overview\nThe first objective of solid waste management is to remove discarded materials from inhabited places in a timely manner to prevent the spread of disease, to minimize the likelihood of fires, and to reduce aesthetic insults arising from putrifying organic mat-ter. The second objective, which is equally important, is to dispose of the discarded materials in a manner that is environmentally responsible.\nPolicy Making.  Solid waste system policy making is primarily a function of the \npublic sector rather than the private sector. The goal of a private firm is to minimize a well-defined cost function or to maximize profits. These are generally not the only, or even the primary, constraints of the public sector. The public objective function is more vague and difficult to express formally. Constraints on the public sector, especially those of a political or a social nature, are difficult to measure, and criteria of effectiveness may not exist in units that can be quantified. Criteria of effectiveness against which public efficiency might be measured include such things as the frequency of collection, types of waste collected, location from which waste is collected, method of disposal, location of disposa"}

Institu-\ntional factors include such things as political feasibility of the system, legislative con-\nstraints, and administrative simplicity. Additional constraints on decision making in the public sector are environmental factors and resource conservation. Environmental factors are most important in the areas of waste storage and disposal because these functions represent prolonged ex-posure of wastes to the environment. Resource conservation is considered seriously by local governments as we become increasingly conscious of the limits of our natural resources. Decisions in solid waste management"}
{"text": " policy formulation must be made in four basic areas: collection, transport, processing, and disposal. The flowchart in Figure 11-3 illustrates the decisions that must be made from the point of generation to the ultimate disposal of residential solid waste. In designing a solid waste collection system, one of the first decisions to be made is where the waste will be picked up: the curb or the backyard. This is an important decision because it affects many other collection variables, including choice of storage containers, crew size, and the selection of collection trucks. Backyard service, once the predominant method of pickup, is still used by some communities. It is generally more costly, but it eliminates the need for scheduled pickups. Another key decision is frequency of collection. Both point of collection and fre-quency of collection should be evaluated in terms of their impact on collection costs. Because collection costs generally account for 70 to 85 percent of total solid waste management costs, and labor represents 60 to 75 percent of collection costs, increases in the productivity of collection personnel can dramatically reduce overall costs. Most communities offer collection once or twice a week, with once per week being the most common schedule (U.S. EPA, 1995). Systems with once-a-week curbside collection help maximize labor productivity and result in significantly lower costs than systems with more frequent collection and/or backyard pickup. The main reason m"}
{"text": "any communities retain twice-a-week backyard service is that the citizens demand this convenience and are willing to pay for it. In warmer regions of the country, twice-a-week service may be deemed essential to pre-vent gross odors and to break the fly-breeding cycle. The egg-larvae-adult cycle is about 4\u20135 days. The choice of solid waste storage containers must be evaluated in terms of both environmental effects and costs. From the environmental standpoint, some storage containers can present health and safety problems to the collectors, as well as to the general public. Therefore, the decision facing a community is which storage system is both environmentally sound and most economical, given the collection system charac-teristics. For example, paper and plastic bags are superior to many other containers from a health and esthetic standpoint and can increase productivity when used in con-junction with curbside collection. However, with backyard collection systems, bags have little effect on productivity. The type of container used may also be dictated by the type of collection. If solid waste is collected manually, then plastic bags or cans can be used. Some com-munities have recently begun to sell special plastic bags or stickers to put on plastic bags that  include the cost of the bag as well as the disposal fee. If the system is dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 791  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 791  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MH"}

The containers typically hold from 1 to 20 cubic meters of waste. Another factor to be considered in examining storage alternatives is home separation of various materials for recovery.

{"text": "pal decision makers is home separation and collection by either the regular collec-\ntion truck equipped with special bins or by separate trucks. One of the primary factors to consider in implementing a separate collection system is whether the benefits of recovery outweigh the costs involved. The eco-nomic viability of separate collection depends primarily on the local market price for the material and the degree of participation by the citizens. If these factors are positive, it may be possible to implement a recovery system with no increase, and possibly a savings, in collection operating costs; often no additional capital expendi-ture is required. Another factor to be considered is the expectation of the community that the municipality be actively involved in recycling. Most people perceive recy-cling as an environmentally friendly practice and so expect municipalities to provide the opportunity. The distance between the disposal site and the center of the city will determine the advisability of including a transfer station in the transport system.* In addition to dis-tance traveled to the disposal site, the time required for the transport is a key factor, especially in traffic-congested large cities. The tradeoffs involved in transfer station operations are the capital and operating costs of the transfer station as compared to the cost (mostly labor) of having route col-lection vehicles travel excessive distances to the disposal site. These tradeoffs can be computed to fi"}
{"text": "nd the point at which transfer becomes economically advantageous. The sheer quantities of solid waste to be disposed of daily makes the problem of what to do with the waste, once it has been collected, among the most difficult prob-lems confronting community officials. A crisis situation can develop very quickly, for example, in the case of an incinerator or land disposal site forced to shut down because of failure to meet newly passed environmental regulations. Alternatively, a crisis can build gradually over a period of time if needed new facilities are not properly planned for and put into service. There are three basic alternatives for disposal. Some have subalternatives. The ma-jor alternatives are: (1) direct disposal of unprocessed waste in a municipal solid waste landfill, (2) processing of waste followed by land disposal, and (3) processing of waste to recover resources (materials and/or energy) with subsequent disposal of the residues. Most municipal solid waste is landfilled, but the amount landfilled declined from 73 percent in 1988 to 56 percent in 2003. Fourteen percent of the waste was incinerated in 2003 and 30 percent was recycled or composted. EPA projects the increase in waste incineration and recycling to continue. Direct haul to a sanitary landfill (with or without transfer and long haul) is usually the cheapest disposal alternative in terms of both operating and capital costs. In 1988, it was estimated that about 8,000 landfills were in operation, but by"}
{"text": " 2002 the number had decreased to about 1,800. Many were closed as a result of regulatory restrictions. Municipalities own 75 percent of the sites (Wolpin, 1994). With rising tipping fees (the \ncost to dump solid waste at a disposal facility), a surplus of disposal capacity has replaced the late 1980s predictions of lack of landfill space.\n*A transfer station is a place where trucks dump their loads into a larger vehicle where it is compacted. By \ncombining loads, the cost per Mg ?  km for transport to the landfill is reduced.dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 793  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 793  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles794  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n With the second alternative, processing prior to land disposal, the primary objective \nis to reduce the volume of wastes. Such volume reduction has definite advantages be-cause it reduces hauling costs and ultimate disposal cost, both of which are, to some extent, a function of waste volume. However, the capital and operating cost to achieve this volume reduction are significant and must be balanced against the savings achieved. An additional consideration is the environmental benefit that might be derived from the volume reduction process. In some cases, shredding and baling may reduce the chances for water pollution from leachate. This alternati"}
{"text": "ve is more conserving of land than sanitary landfilling of unprocessed wastes, but by itself provides no opportu-nity for material or energy recovery. The third category of disposal alternatives includes those processes that recover energy or materials from solid waste and leave only a residue for ultimate land dis-posal. There are significant capital and operating costs associated with all these energy and/or materials recovery systems. However, if markets are available, both energy and materials can be sold to reduce the net costs of recovery.\n While resource recovery techniques may be more costly than other disposal alter-natives, they do achieve the goal of resource conservation while enhancing sustain-ability and the residuals of the processes require much less space for land disposal than unprocessed wastes.\n Affecting all four major functions are basic decisions regarding how the solid waste system will be managed and operated. This includes how the system will be fi-nanced, which level of government will administer it, and whether a public agency or private firm will operate the collection, transport, processing, and disposal functions. The criteria most relevant for making these decisions are the institutional factors of  political feasibility and legislative constraints.\nIntegrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM).  The selection of a combination of \ntechniques, technologies, and management programs to achieve waste management objectives is called integrated solid wast"}
{"text": "e management (ISWM). This approach has made major strides in recent years. The EPA proposed a hierarchy of actions to imple-ment ISWM: source reduction (including reuse and waste reduction), recycling and composting, and disposal in combustion facilities and landfills (U.S. EPA, 1995). The most obvious effect of the integrated approach is to reduce the size of the incineration facility. This reduces the capital cost of the incineration facility. Although the energy output is also reduced, the waste that remains has a higher energy content so that the reduction in energy output is less than the reduction in plant size. Recycling also re-duces waste elements that can damage the boilers and removes those components that slag in the furnace and foul it (Shortsleeve and Roche, 1990).\n11-2 COLLECTION\nThe solid waste collection policies of a city begin with decisions made by elected repre-sentatives about whether collection is to be made by: (1) city employees (municipal collection), (2) private firms that contract with city government (contract collection), or (3) private firms that contract with private residents (private collection). Many communities have moved away from exclusive municipal collection and toward a combined system. dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 794  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 794  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav011"}
{"text": "45_pagefilesSOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT   795\nMore and more communities are moving toward mandatory recycling of materials such \nas paper, plastic, and glass. In these situations, separation of waste is required. Elected officials may also determine what type of solid wastes are to be collected and from whom. In some municipalities broad classes of solid wastes (such as rubbish) are not accepted for collection. In others, certain materials (such as tires, grass trim-mings, furniture, or dead animals) may be excluded. Hazardous wastes are generally excluded from regular collections because of disposal and collection dangers. The nature of the service may be governed by limitations of disposal facilities or by the opinion of the legislative body as to what service should be performed. A city may collect garbage only or it may collect everything but garbage. Almost all municipal systems collect residential waste, but only about one-third collect industrial waste. The final decision concerning collection, which is made by the elected officials, is the frequency of collection. The proper frequency for the most satisfactory and eco-nomical service is governed by the amount of solid waste that must be collected and by climate, cost, and public requests. For the collection of solid waste that contains garbage, the maximum period should not be greater than\n 1. The normal time for the accumulation of the amount that can be placed in \ncontainers of reasonable size.\n 2. The time it takes for "}
{"text": "fresh garbage to putrefy and emit foul odors under aver-\nage storage conditions.\n 3. The length of the fly-breeding cycle, which, during the hot summer months, is \nless than seven days.\nIn the last three decades the prevailing frequency of collection has changed from twice \na week pickup to once a week. The increased use of once per week service is due to two factors. First, unit costs are reduced when frequency is cut from twice to once per week. Second, the increased percentage of paper and decreased percentage of garbage in the solid waste permit longer periods of acceptable storage. Once policy has been set, the actual method of collection is determined by engineers or managers. Major considerations include how the solid waste will be collected, how the crews will be managed, how the trucks will be routed, and the type of equipment to be used.\nCollection Methods\nThe first decision to be made is how the solid waste container will get from the  residence to the collection vehicle. The three basic methods are: (1) curbside or alley pickup, (2)  set-out, set-back collection, and (3) backyard pickup, or the tote barrel \nmethod. Most urban and suburban areas utilize curbside pickup, but a few communities still use backyard pickup. In some less populated areas, municipal waste collection is sometimes accomplished by requiring residents to transport waste to a specified point. This point may be a transfer station or the disposal site. This is the least expensive method for a muni"}

Usually the city designates what type of con-\ntainers are to be used. The crews simply empty the containers into the collection ve-hicles. Whenever possible the crews collect from both sides of the street at the same time. Municipal ordinances or administrative regulations usually specify when the containers must be placed at the curb or in the alley for pickup and also how long they may remain after pickup. Common limits are out by 7 a.m. and back by 7 p.m. When solid wastes are loaded from curbs or alleys, work progresses rapidly. A typical crew consists of a driver and two collectors. Some crews still have three or even four collec-tors, but the trend is toward fewer collectors. Recent studies indicate that small crews are more efficient than larger ones, because labor costs are a major element of the total cost. Aside from the cost advantage of this method, it also eliminates the need for the"}
{"text": " collectors to enter private property, and the amount of service given each homeowner is relatively uniform. However, many citizens dislike having to set their solid wastes out at certain times and object to the unsightly appearance on the streets. Some surveys have shown that many homeowners would prefer to pay more in order to receive back-yard service. When curbside removal is chosen, automatic and semiautomatic collection vehicles can be utilized. In an automated system, residents are provided with large specialized containers (approximately 90 gallons), which they roll to the curb. These containers are then lifted by powerful hydraulic arms that empty the contents of the container into the truck\u2019s hopper. The crew, or often just the driver, performs the operation from inside the cab of the collection vehicle. A typical side-loading vehicle with a hydraulic arm is shown in Figure 11-4. A fully automated system can be the most  economical for a \nFIGURE 11-4\nSide-loading refuse collection vehicle with hydraulic lift arm.

{"text": "lso uses this single truck to collect recycla-\nbles. The city of Los Angeles converted to such a system and in 2000 collected 712 Gg of refuse, recyclables, and yard waste with automated sideloading trucks. The waste is then transported to a waste processing facility where the materials are separated. However, many communities cannot accommodate these large vehicles in their existing residential neighborhoods. They therefore use some combination of automatic and semiautomatic vehicles. In a semiautomatic system, the crew wheels the cart to the collection vehicle, lines the cart up with the lifting device and activates the lifter. A hydraulic device lifts and tips the cart, allowing the contents to fall into the hopper of the truck. The existence of cul de sacs, alleys, and narrow streets as well as low-hanging util-ity lines may dictate the type of vehicle selected. For example, the city of Houston uses three different types of vehicles in its fleet of 200 vehicles. The city uses automated sideloaders to pick up curbside trash as well as recyclables, semiautomatic rear loaders to pick up yard waste, and a combination of rear loaders and a one-operator heavy-duty vehicle equipped with a grapple to pick up heavy trash to deposit in the rear loader (Bader, 2001, and Luken and Bush, 2002). The set-out, set-back method eliminates most of the disadvantages of the curb method, but it does require the collector to enter private property. This method consists of the following operatio"}
{"text": "ns: (1) the set-out crew carries the full containers from the residential storage location to the curb or alley before the collection vehicle arrives, (2) the collection crew loads the refuse in the same manner as the curb method, and (3) the set-back crew returns the empty cans. Any of the crew may be required to do more than one step or the homeowner may be required to do one of the steps. This method has not been shown to be more economical or advantageous than the backyard method, and it is more costly and time-consuming than curbside pickup. Backyard pickup is usually accomplished by the use of tote barrels. In this method, the collector enters the resident\u2019s property, dumps the container into a tote barrel,  carries it to the truck, and dumps it. The collector may collect refuse from more than one house before returning to the truck to dump. The primary advantage of this system is in the convenience to the homeowner. The major disadvantage is the high cost. Many home-owners object to having the collectors enter their private property. With this collection method, a rear-loading vehicle, such as the one shown in Figure 11-5, is used. Cost analyses have revealed that 70 to 85 percent of the cost of solid waste col-lection and disposal can be attributed to the collection phase. For this reason, it would seem that a great deal of municipal effort should be directed to studying collection alternatives to determine the most efficient system. However, many analyses begin their"}
{"text": " studies assuming that waste loads are already collected and waiting for disposal. There are two major reasons why the collection system is not studied more often. First, the collection system is a complex and expensive system to analyze. The pri-mary reasons for this are that it involves people, equipment, and levels of service, plus the possibility of numerous variations in secondary factors such as collection method-ology; quantity, nature, and the method of storage of refuse; location of pickup point; equipment type and characteristics of operation; road factors; service density; route  topography; climatic factors; and human factors. Human factors would include morale, incentive, fatigue, and other variables that influence the time required to complete a dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 797  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 797  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles798  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\ngiven task.

The most important thing to realize about the solid waste collection system is that it is too big, complex, and vital to allow actual experimentation except on a very small scale. Coupled with this are all the other problems peculiar to studying large-scale public systems. A relevant data-base is probably nonexistent. The political implications of control of the system and cost distribution may override an otherwise practical solution. A large invest-ment will have already been made in the existing system and the designer is not allowed the luxury of starting at the beginning, but must start with a system that may be founded on a pyramid of errors. EPA suggests a method that can be used to estimate the time requirements of a waste collection system in order to evaluate and subsequently optimize the system (U. S. EPA, 1995). The steps included in a time study are shown in Table 11-3.\nFIGURE 11-5\nTypical rear-loading refuse collection vehicle.

Crew fatigue allowance (F) should include adequate rest time for recovery from heavy lifting, extreme hot and cold weather conditions, and other circumstances encountered in waste collection.

{"text": "1145_pagefiles800  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nWaste Collection System Design Calculations\nOften, it is desirable to calculate \u201cquick and dirty\u201d estimates of such things as crew size, \ndesired truck capacity, and labor and capital costs. Simple formulas have been developed that enable such calculations. The formulas are based on crude averages regarding col-lection times, and they make broad assumptions. An example of a not-always-justifiable assumption is that if one collector can collect a house in one minute, then two can do it in one-half minute. Several such equations follow.\nEstimating Truck Capacity.

{"text": " speed is a function of the total round-trip distance to the dis-posal site (Figure 11-6). As noted in the definitions, the volume carried presumes a mean density, D\nT. This is the density that results after the waste has been compacted in \nthe truck. The compaction ratio ( r) is the ratio of the density after compaction to that \nbefore  compaction. Typical densities \u201cas discarded\u201d are given for several solid waste components in Table 11-4. If, for example, paper waste was compacted to a density of 163.4 kg/m\n3, the compaction ratio would be two to one. Compactor trucks can achieve \ndensities ranging from 300 to 600 kg/m3.\n A value for t p can be estimated from empirical data (U. Calif., 1952; Stone, 1969). \nThe data may be approximated by linear equations of the following form:\n t\u00bfp5tbp1a(Cn)1b(PRH ) (11-2)\n*We should note that it is standard practice to allow two fifteen-minute breaks during the day.

In order to ensure once-a-\nweek pickup the truck must service 250 locations per day. The disposal site is 6.4 km away from the collection route. From past experience, a delay time of 13 minutes can be  expected. The data given in Table 11-4 have been found to be typical for the entire city. Each stop typically has three cans containing 4 kg each. About 10 percent of the stops are backyard pickups. Assume that two trips per day will be made to the disposal site.

{"text": "y is the daily route method. In this method the crew has a definite route that must be finished before going home. When the route is finished the crew can leave, but if necessary, they must work overtime to finish the route. This is the simplest method and the most common. The advantages of this method are as follows:\n 1. The homeowner knows when the refuse will be picked up.\n 2. The route sizes can be adjusted for the load to maximize crew and truck \n utilization.\n 3. The crew likes the method because it provides an incentive to get done early.\nThe disadvantages include:\n 1. If the route is not finished, the crew will work overtime, which will increase \nthe expense.\n 2. The crew may have a tendency to become careless as they try to finish the job \nsooner.\n 3. Frequently the result is underutilization of the crew and equipment due to the \nincreased incentive of the crew.\n 4. A breakdown seriously affects operations.dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 805  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 805  10/25/11  11:11 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles806  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n 5. It is hard to plan routes if the load is variable, because of the disposal of yard \nwastes and the like.\n The next method is the large route method. In this scheme the crew has enough \nwork to last the entire week. The route must be completed in one week."}
{"text": " The crew is left on its own to decide when to pick up the route. Usually some time off at the end of the week is the goal of the crew. This method is only good for backyard pickup because the residents don\u2019t know when pickup will be. The same advantages and disadvantages apply to this method as to the daily route method. In the single load method, the routes are planned to get a full truck load. Each crew is assigned as many loads as it can collect per day. The biggest advantage of this method is that it can minimize travel time. The method must consider size of crew, capacity of truck, length of travel, refuse generated, and similar variables. Other advantages include:\n 1. A full day\u2019s work can be provided for maximum utilization of the crew and \nequipment.\n 2. It can be used for any type of pickup.\nThe major disadvantage is that it is hard to predict the number of homes that can be \nserviced before the truck is filled. The last method is the definite working day method. As its name implies, the crew works for its assigned number of hours and quits. This method predominates in areas where unions are strong. With this method, the crew and the equipment get maximum utilization. Regularity is sacrificed with this method, and residents have little idea when pickup will occur. Having determined the method by which the trucks will be managed, it is still neces-sary to find the actual route the truck will follow through the city. The purpose of routing and districting is to subdiv"}
{"text": "ide the community into units that will permit collection crews to work efficiently. No matter what the size of the community, it can be divided into districts, with each district constituting one day\u2019s work for the crew. The route is the detailed path of travel for the collection vehicle. The size of each route  depends upon various factors as discussed earlier. The Office of Solid Waste Management Programs of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has developed a simple, noncomputerized \u201cheuristic\u201d (rule-of-thumb) approach to routing based on logical principles. The goal is to minimize deadheading, delay, and left turns. This method relies on developing, recog-nizing, and using certain patterns that repeat themselves in every municipality. Routing skills can be quickly acquired by applying the rules and developing experience. The following rules are taken from an EPA publication (Shuster and Schur, 1974).\n 1. Routes should not be fragmented or overlapped. Each route should be com-\npact, consisting of street segments clustered in the same geographical area.\n 2. Total collection plus haul times should be reasonably constant for each route \nin the community (equalized workloads).\n 3. The collection route should be started as close to the garage or motor pool as \npossible, taking into account heavily traveled and one-way streets.

Heavily traveled streets should not be collected during rush hours.\n 5. In the case of one-way streets, it is best to start the route near the upper end of \nthe street, working down it through the looping process.\n 6. Services on dead-end streets can be considered as services on the street seg-\nment that they intersect, because they can only be collected by passing down \nthat street segment. To keep left turns at a minimum, collect the dead-end streets when they are to the right of the truck. They must be collected by walking down, backing down, or making a U-turn.\n 7. When practical, service stops on steep hills should be collected on both sides \nof the street while the vehicle is moving downhill for safety, ease, speed of collection, wear on vehicle, and conservation of gas and oil.\n 8. Higher elevations should be at the start of the route.\n 9. For collection from one side of the street at a time, it is generally best to route \nwith many clockwise turns around blocks. (Authors\u2019 note: Heuristic rules 8 and 9 emphasize the development of a series of clockwise loops in order to minimize left turns, which generally are more difficult and time-consuming than right turns. Especially for right-hand-drive vehicles, right turns are safer.)\n 10. For collection from both sides of the street at the same time, it is gen"}
{"text": "erally best \nto route with long, straight paths across the grid before looping clockwise.\n 11. For certain block configurations within the route, specific routing patterns \nshould be applied.\nSee Figure 11-7 for an example of the heuristic routing procedure.\nCrew Integration\nAnother area of consideration is the integration of several crews. There are four ways of managing crews; usually some combination of the four is employed by any given city. The swing crew method utilizes an extra crew as standby for heavy pickups, breakdown, or illness. Many times this crew will not report until noon to begin its day. Crew sizes may be varied because of heavy loads, rain, different route sizes, and other factors. This is referred to as the variable crew method. With the interroute relay method, when a crew member finishes one job, he or she is put on another route that needs additional help. This method requires more administration to operate, but results in better utilization of personnel and helps ensure that all routes will be completed during the day. Some form of this method has found wide acceptance with good results. Management must be sure that the workload is being balanced fairly and that a faster worker doesn\u2019t have to carry the load for others. The last possibility is the reservoir route method. In this method, the crews work around a central core. When they have finished the route, the crews go to the core and begin picking up there. The core is usually an every day pickup, "}

In these cases, the solid waste is transferred from several collection vehicles to a larger vehicle, which then carries it to the disposal site. The larger vehicle (transfer vehicle) may be a tractor-trailer, railroad car, or barge. A special facility, called a transfer station, must be constructed to permit this exchange in a rapid and sanitary fashion. Among the more important considerations in planning and designing a transfer station are location, type of station, sanitation, access, and accessories such as weighing scales and fences. The use of a transfer station may also provide for present or future resource recovery facilities.\nMaximum Haul Time\nAs in estimating collection times, it is possible to use average values to evaluate trad-eoffs in transfer station effectiveness. One such method is to compute the travel time FIGURE 11-7\nArrows show heuristic routing pattern developed for a \nnorth-south, one-way street combined with east-west, two-way streets.

Cost is  usually the prime consideration. Costs are saved when a transfer operation is used because\n 1. The nonproductive time of collectors is reduced, because they no longer ride \nto and from the disposal site.

The capital cost of collection equipment may be reduced; because the trucks \nwill be traveling only on improved roads, lighter duty, less expensive models can be used (U.S. EPA, 1995).\n In order to compare \u201cdirect haul\u201d with \u201ctransfer\u201d costs, the costs are computed on the basis of $/Mg ? km or, preferably, $/Mg ? min. The time-based comparison is pre-ferred because the average haul speed of the collection vehicle will often be greater than that of the transfer vehicle. Because it is time, not distance, that costs money, this gives a fairer comparison. In addition to the travel cost of operating the transfer vehi-cle, there are fixed costs for the construction and operation of the transfer station and for maneuvering and unloading the transfer vehicle. Figure 11-8 may be used to esti-mate the cost of the transfer station.\nExample 11-3.  The disposal site for Watapitae will be closed in two years  because \nof the lack of capacity. An alternative disposal site will be available when the  present site is closed. It will be a countywide regional system that will be 32.5 km from the collection route.

However, because we have reduced the number of trips to the disposal site, we must either provide an additional  vehicle of the same size or replace the existing one with one that is twice as large. Because the existing crew size can handle the 250 pickups per day, the more logical choice would seem to be to choose the larger vehicle. (This is especially true  because the existing one is about to expire.) Let us assume the new vehicle will have a  capacity of 10.0 m\n3.\n Now let us examine the comparative haul costs.

Opposition by local citizens eliminates many potential sites. In choosing a location for a landfill, consideration should be given to the following variables:\n 1. Public opposition\n 2. Proximity of major roadways\n 3. Speed limits\n 4. Load limits on roadways\n 5. Bridge capacities\n 6. Underpass limitations\n 7. Traffic patterns and congestion\n 8. Haul distance (in time)\n 9. Detours\n 10. Hydrology\n 11. Availability of cover material\n 12. Climate (for example, floods, mud slides, snow)\n 13. Zoning requirements\n 14. Buffer areas around the site (for example, high trees on the site perimeter)\n 15. Historic buildings, endangered species, wetlands, and similar environmental \nfactors.dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 812  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 812  10/25/"}

These regulations are known as the Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (MSWLF Criteria). EPA also published a companion document to assist owners and municipalities comply with these criteria (U.S. EPA, 1998). These included siting criteria that specify restric-tions on distances from airports, flood plains, and fault areas, as well as limitations on construction in wetlands, seismic impact areas, and other areas of unstable geology such as landslide areas and those susceptible to sink holes. Other restrictions may apply. For example, a landfill should be more than:\n30 m from streams,\n160 m from drinking water wells,65 m from houses, schools, and parks, and3,000 m from airport runways.\nSite Preparation\nThe plans and specifications for a MSW landfill should require that certain steps \nbe carried out before operations begin. These steps include grading the site area, constructing access roads and fences, and installing signs, utilities, and operating facilities. On-site access roads should be of all-weather construction and wide enough to permit two-way truck travel (7.3 m). Grades should not exceed equipment limitations. For loaded vehic"}
{"text": "les, most uphill grades should be less than 7 percent, and downhill grades should be less than 10 percent. All MSW landfill sites should have electric, water, and sanitary services. Remote sites may have to use acceptable substitutes, for example, portable chemical toilets, trucked-in drinking water, and electric generators. Water should be available for drink-ing, fire-fighting, dust control, and sanitation. Telephone or radio communications are desirable. A small MSW landfill operation will usually require only a small building for storing hand tools and equipment parts and a shelter with sanitary facilities. A sin-gle building may serve both purposes. Buildings may be temporary and preferably movable.\nEquipment\nThe size, type, and amount of equipment required at an MSW landfill depends on the size and method of operation, quantities and time of solid waste deliveries, and, to a degree, the experience and preference of the designer and equipment operators. An-other factor to be considered is the availability and dependability of service from the equipment. The most common equipment used on MSW landfills is the crawler or rubber-tired tractor (Figure 11-9). The tractor can be used with a dozer blade, trash blade, or a front-end loader. A tractor is versatile and can perform a variety of operations: spreading, dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 813  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 813  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1"}

The decision on \nwhether to select a rubber-tired or a crawler-type tractor, and a dozer blade, trash blade, or front-end loader must be based on the conditions at each individual site (see Table 11-5). The crawler dozer is excellent for grading and can be economically used for doz-ing solid waste or soil over distances up to 100 m. The larger trash or landfill blade can be used in lieu of a straight dozer blade, thereby increasing the volume of solid waste that can be dozed. The crawler loader has the capability to lift materials off the ground for carrying. It is an excellent excavator, well suited for trench operations. Rubber-tired machines are generally faster than crawler machines. Because their loads are concentrated more, rubber-tired machines have less flotation and traction than crawler machines. Rubber-tired machines can be economically operated at dis-tances of up to 200 m. Steel-wheeled compactors are finding increased application at MSW landfills.

Use of compactors should be \n restricted to solid waste, because their design does not lend them to application of a \nsmooth layer of compacted cover material. Thus, compactors are best used in \n conjunction with tracked or rubber-tired machines that can be used for cover mate-\nrial application.\n Other equipment used at MSW landfills are scrapers, water wagons, drag-lines, \ndump trucks, and graders. This type of equipment is normally found only at large solid \nwaste landfills where specialized equipment increases the overall efficiency.\n Equipment size depends on the size of the operation. Small landfills for communi-\nties of 15,000 or less, or landfills handling 50 Mg of solid wastes per day or less, can \noperate successfully with one tractor in the 20 to 30 Mg range. Heavier equipment in \nthe 30 to 45 Mg range, or larger, can handle more waste and achieve better compac-\ntion. Heavy equipment is recommended for MSW landfill sites serving more than \n15,000 people or handling more than 50 Mg per day. MSW landfills serving 50,000 \npeople or less or handling no more than about 150 Mg of solid waste per day normally \ncan manage well with one piece of heavy equipment (30 to 45 Mg range).\nOperation\nAlthough various titles are used to describe the operating methods employed at MSW \nlandfills, only two basic techniques are involved.

{"text": "They are termed the area method  \n(Figure 11-10) and the trench method  (Figure 11-11). At many sites, both methods are \nused, either simultaneously or sequentially.\n In the area method, the solid waste is deposited on the surface, compacted, then \ncovered with a layer of compacted soil at the end of the working day. Use of the area \nmethod is seldom restricted by topography; flat or rolling terrain, canyons, and other \ntypes of depressions are all acceptable.

In this method a trench is excavated; the solid waste is placed in it and compacted; and the soil that was taken from the trench is then laid on the waste and compacted. The advantage of the trench method is that cover material is readily available as a  result of trench excavation. Stockpiles can be created by excavating long trenches, or the material can be dug up daily. The depth depends on the location of the groundwater and/or the char"}

A MSW landfill does not need to be operated by using only the area or trench method. Combinations of the two are possible. The methods used can be varied ac-cording to the constraints of the particular site. A profile view of a typical landfill is shown in Figure 11-12. The waste and the daily cover placed in a landfill during one operational period form a cell. The oper-ational period is usually one day. The waste is dumped by the collection and transfer vehicles onto the working face. It is spread in 0.4 to 0.6 m layers and compacted by driving a crawler tractor or other compaction equipment over it. At the end of each day cover material is placed over the cell. The cover material may be native soil or other approved materials. Its purpose is to prevent fires, odors, blowing litter, and scaveng-ing. The federal regulations also permit the state regulatory authority to allow the use of alternative daily covers (ADC) if the owner of the landfill can demonstrate that the alternative material functions as well as the earthen cover without presenting a threat to human health or the environment. Some landfills have successfully demonstrated that diverted wastes such as chipped tires, yard waste, shredded wood waste, and  petroleum-contaminated soils can be used effectively as ADCs.

Recommended depths of cover for various exposure \nperiods are given in Table 11-6. The dimensions of a cell are determined by the amount of waste and the operational period. A lift may refer to the placement of a layer of waste or the completion of the hori-\nzontal active area of the landfill. In Figure 11-12 a lift is shown as the completion of the active area of the landfill. An extra layer of intermediate cover may be provided if the lift is exposed for long periods. The active area may be up to 300 m in length and width. The side slopes typically range from 1.5:1 to 2:1. Trenches vary in length from 30 to 300 m with widths of 5 to 15 m. The trench depth may be 3 to 9 m (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993). Benches are used where the height of the landfill exceeds 15 to 20 m.

Good compaction of the waste, daily cover-ing of the solid waste with good compaction of the cover, and good housekeeping are musts for control of flies, rodents, and fires. Burning, which may cause air pollution, is never permitted at a MSW landfill. If accidental fires should occur, they should be extinguished immediately using soil, water, or chemicals. Odors can be controlled by covering the wastes quickly and carefully, and by sealing any cracks that may develop in the cover.\nLandfill Gases.  The principal gaseous products emitted from a landfill (methane and \ncarbon dioxide) are the result of microbial decomposition. Typical concentrations of landfill gases and their characteristics are summarized in Table 11-7. During the early life of the landfill, the predominant gas is carbon dioxide. As the landfill matures, the gas is composed almost equally of carbon dioxide and methane. Because the methane is ex-plosive, its movement must be controlled.

At the end of 2004, there were 378 landfill gas (LFG) recovery projects in the United States. This is a four-fold increase over the 86 LFG projects operating in 1990. Because of their toxicity, trace gas emissions from landfills are of concern. More than 150 compounds have been measured at various landfills. Many of these may be classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The occurrence of significant VOC concentrations is often associated with older landfills that previously accepted industrial and commercial wastes containing these compounds. The concentrations of 10 com-pounds measured in landfill gases from several California sites are shown in Table 11-8.\nLeachate\nLiquid that passes through the landfill and th"}

The liquid enters the landfill from external sources such as rainfall, surface drainage, groundwater, and the liquid in and produced from the decomposition of the waste.\nLeachate Quantity.  The amount of leachate generated from a landfill site may be \nestimated using a hydrologic mass balance for the landfill. Those portions of the global hydrologic cycle (see Chapter 4) that typically apply to a landfill site include precipita-tion, surface runoff, evaporation, transpiration (when the landfill cover is completed), infiltration, and storage. Precipitation may be estimated in the conventional fashion from climatological records. Surface runoff or run-on may be estimated using the ra-tional formula (Equation 4-19 or 4-20). Evaporation and transpiration are often lumped together as evapotranspiration. It may be estimated from regional data such as that provided by the U.S. Geologic Service Water Atlas. Infiltration (and exfiltration) may be estimated using Darcy\u2019s law (Equation 4-27). Until the landfill becomes saturated, some of the water infiltration will be stored in both the cover material and the waste. The quantity of water that can be held against the pull of gravity is referred to as field \ncapacity (Figure 11-13 on page 822). Theoretically, when the landfill reaches its field capacity, leachate will begin to be produced. Then, the potential quantity of leachate is the amount of moisture within t"}

Aerobic and anaerobic decom-position of the organic matter results in both gaseous and liquid end products. Some materials are chemically oxidized.

Because of the differential heads (slope of the piezometric surface), the water containing dissolved substances moves into the groundwater system. The result is gross pollution of the groundwater.\nBioreactor Landfills\nThe implementation of RCRA Subtitle D resulted in more stringent protection of the environment, particularly the groundwater resources. The future trend in landfill  design appears to be the development of engineered systems that optimize waste  degradation and so minimize the amount of land needed for waste disposal. One tech-nology that shows a lot of promise is bioreactor landfills. EPA has initiated a number of studies and partnerships with waste management companies to fully investigate the potential of this technology. In traditional municipal solid waste landfills, organic waste eventually decom-poses and stabilizes. These processes are controlled by microorganisms. In bioreactor landfills, biological decomposition is accelerated by enhancing the conditions  necessary for these microorganisms to flourish. This is accomplished by the controlled addition of supplemental air and water. The degradation and stabilization of organic waste is then accelerated.0102030405060\n024\nMonthMoisture content, cm/m\n68 1 0Saturation\nBare soil, no vegetation\nField capacity\nVegetative cover\nPermanaent wilting percentageDrai"}

In these landfills additional moisture is introduced to \nthe waste, typically by recirculating the leachate and adding additional moisture such as stormwater, wastewater, and wastewater treatment plant sludge. The goal is to provide enough moisture to the waste to maintain the optimal moisture content for microbial decomposition, typically 35 to 65 percent moisture. One of the benefits of this system is that the decomposition rate is increased, so complete decomposition can occur in years instead of decades. The waste density is increased, so over the life of the landfill, 15 to 30 percent additional space is available. Also, the cost of the leachate disposal is reduced, because it is recirculated. And there is a significant increase in the landfill gas that is generated. If this is captured on-site, then it can be u"}

{"text": "nisms.\nPhases of Bioreaction.   Five more or less sequential phases of bioreaction are \nthought to occur in a landfill. In the initial adjustment phase, the organic biodegrad-\nable components in the MSW undergo aerobic biodegradation because some air is \ntrapped when the waste is placed in the landfill. In a conventional landfill, the principle source of microorganisms is the soil material that is used as daily and final cover.  Digested wastewater treatment plant sludge as well as recycled leachate are also sources of microorganisms. In a bioreactor landfill, the latter sources provide a means of accelerating the decomposition process. The second phase is called the transitional phase. Oxygen is depleted and an-oxic and anaerobic conditions begin to develop. As the landfill becomes anaerobic, nitrate and sulfate serve as electron acceptors. Nitrogen, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide are products of the decomposition process. As the conversion process pro-ceeds, the microbial community responsible for conversion of organic material to methane and carbon dioxide begin the three-step process described in Chapter 8 (Figure 8-35). In the acid phase, the anaerobic microbial activity initiated in the second phase \n accelerates. Significant amounts of organic acids are produced and the production of hydrogen decreases. Carbon dioxide is the principle gas produced in this phase. The pH of the leachate will often drop to 5 or lower (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993). The fourth phase is calle"}

Flexible membrane liners consisting of high-density \npolyethylene (HDPE) must be at least 60 mils thick (40 CFR 257 and 258, and FR 9 OCT 1991).

Some examples include polyvinyl \nchloride (PVC), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), and ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM). Designers show a strong preference for PVC and especially for HDPE. Although the geomembranes are highly imperme-able (hydraulic conductivities are often less than 1 3 10\n212 cm/s), they can be easily \ndamaged or improperly installed.

Installation errors primarily occur during seaming when two pieces of geomembrane must be attached or when piping must pass through the liner. A liner placed with adequate quality control should have less than 3 to 5 defects per hectare. The soil layer under the geomembrane acts as a foundation for the geomembrane and as a backup for control of leachate flow to the groundwater. Compacted clay gen-erally meets the requirement for a hydraulic conductivity of less than 1 3 10\n27 cm/s. \nIn addition to having a low permeability, it should be: free of sharp objects greater than 1 cm in diameter, graded evenly without pockets or hillocks, compacted to prevent dif-ferential settlement, and free of cracks.\nLeachate Breakthrough.

In addition to carrying the leachate, this layer also protects the geomembrane from mechanical damage from equipment and solid waste. In some instances a geonet (a synthetic matrix that resembles a miniature chain link fence), with a geofabric (an open-weave cloth) protective layer to keep out the sand, is placed under the sand and above the geomembrane to  increase the flow of leachate to the pipe system.\n*Underdrain pipes are perforated pipes designed to collect the leachate.dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 831  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 831  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles832  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n Several different methods for estimating the steady-state maximum leachate depth \nhave been proposed.

It also promotes the production of methane and provides some treatment for the biodegradable fraction of the constituents in the leachate.\nFinal Cover.  The major function of the final cover is to prevent moisture from enter-\ning the finished landfill. If no moisture enters, then at some point in time the leachate production will reach minimal proportions and the chance of groundwater contamina-tion will be minimized. Modern final cover design consists of a surface layer, biotic barrier, drainage layer, hydraulic barrier, foundation layer, and gas control. The surface layer is to provide suit-able soil for plants to grow. This minimizes erosion. A soil depth of about 0.3 m is ap-propriate for grass. The biotic barrier is to prevent the roots of the plants from penetrating the hydraulic barrier. At this time, there does not seem to be a suitable mate-rial for this barrier. The drainage layer serves the same function here as in the leachate collection system\u2014that is, it provides an easy flow path to a grid of perforated pipes. This collection piping system is subject to differential settling and may fail because of this settling. Some designers do not recommend installing it as they prefer to use the funds to develop a thicker hydraulic barrier. The hydraulic barrier serves the same func-tion"}
{"text": " as the liner in that it prevents movement of water into the landfill. The EPA recom-mends a composite liner consisting of a geomembrane and a low hydraulic conductivity soil that also serves as the foundation for the geomembrane. This soil also protects the geomembrane from the rough aggregate in the gas control layer. The gas control layer is constructed of coarse gravel that acts as a vent to carry the gases to the surface. If the gas is to be collected for its energy value, a series of gas recovery wells is installed. A negative pressure is placed on these wells to draw the gas into the system.\nCompleted MSW Landfills\nCompleted landfills generally require maintenance because of uneven settling. Mainte-nance consists primarily of regrading the surface to maintain good drainage and filling in small depressions to prevent ponding and possible subsequent groundwater pollu-tion. The final soil cover should be about 0.6 m deep. Completed landfills have been used for recreational purposes such as parks, play-grounds, or golf courses. Parking and storage areas or botanical gardens are other final uses. Because of the characteristic uneven settling and gas evolution from landfills, construction of buildings on completed landfills should be avoided. On occasion, one-story buildings and runways for light aircraft might be con-structed. In such cases, it is important to avoid concentrated foundation loading, which can result in uneven settling and cracking of the structure. The desig"}

Specially designed power plants known as waste-to-energy facilities can produce en-ergy through the combustion of municipal solid waste. In these facilities, trash volume is reduced by 90 percent and its weight by 75 percent. The remaining residue is dis-posed of in a MSW landfill. According to a 2004 Integrated Waste Services Associa-tion publication, 89 waste-to-energy facilities were in operation as of that time, disposing of 86 Gg of waste each day (IWSA, 2004). This waste was converted to ap-proximately 2,500 megawatts of electric power.\nHeating Value of Waste\nThe heating value of waste is measured in kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg), and is de-termined experimentally using a bomb calorimeter. A dry sample is placed in a cham-ber and burned. The heat released at a constant temperature of 258 C is calculated \nfrom a heat balance. Because the combustion chamber is maintained at 258C,"}
{"text": " combus-\ntion water produced in the oxidation reaction remains in the liquid state. This condi-tion produces the maximum heat release and is defined as the higher heating value  \n(HHV). In actual combustion processes, the temperature of the combustion gas remains above 1008C until the gas is discharged into the atmosphere. Consequently, the water from actual combustion processes is always in the vapor state. The heating value for actual combustion is termed the lower heating value (LHV). The following equation gives the relationship between HHV and LHV:\n LHV 5HHV 2[(\u00a2H\nv)(9 H)] (11-17)\nwhere DH v 5 heat of vaporization of water\n 5 2,420 kJ/kg\n H 5 hydrogen content of combusted material\nThe factor of 9 results because one gram mole of hydrogen will produce 9 gram moles \nof water (that is, 18/2). Note that this water is only that resulting from the combustion reaction. If the waste is wet, the free water must also be evaporated. The energy required to evaporate this water may be substantial. This results in a very inefficient combustion process from the point of view of energy recovery. The ash content also reduces the energy yield because it reduces the proportion of dry organic matter per kilogram of fuel and because it retains some heat when it is removed from the furnace.\nFundamentals of Combustion\nCombustion is a chemical reaction where the elements in the fuel are oxidized. In waste-to-energy (WTE) plants, the fuel is, of course, the solid waste. The major oxi-dizable ele"}
{"text": "ments in the fuel are carbon and hydrogen. To a lesser extent sulfur and ni-trogen are also present. With complete oxidation, carbon is oxidized to carbon dioxide, hydrogen to water, and sulfur to sulfur dioxide. Some fraction of the nitrogen may be oxidized to nitrogen oxides.dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 834  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 834  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesSOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT   835\n The combustion reactions are a function of oxygen, time, temperature, and turbu-\nlence (O, T, T, T). There must be a sufficient excess of oxygen to drive the reaction to completion in a short period of time. The oxygen is most frequently supplied by forc-ing air into the combustion chamber. Over 100 percent excess air may be provided to ensure a sufficient excess. Sufficient time must be provided for the combustion reac-tions to proceed. The amount of time is a function of the combustion temperature and the turbulence in the combustion chamber. Some minimum temperature must be ex-ceeded to initiate the combustion reaction (that is, to ignite the waste). Higher tem-peratures also yield higher quantities of nitrogen oxide emissions, so there is a tradeoff in destroying the solid waste and forming air pollutants. Mixing of the combustion air and the combustion gases is essential for completion of the reaction. As the"}
{"text": " solid waste enters the combustion chamber and its temperature increases, volatile materials are driven off as gases. Rising temperatures cause the organic com-ponents to thermally \u201ccrack\u201d and form gases. When the volatile compounds are driven off, fixed carbon remains. When the temperature reaches the ignition temperature of carbon (7008C), it is ignited. To achieve destruction of all the combustible material (burnout), it is necessary to achieve 7008 C throughout the bed of waste and ash \n (Pfeffer, 1992). The flame zone is that area where the hot volatilized gases mix with oxygen. This reaction is very rapid. It goes to completion within 1 or 2 seconds if there is sufficient excess air and turbulence. The evolution of solid waste combustion has led to higher temperatures both to destroy toxic compounds and to increase the opportunity to utilize the waste as an en-ergy source by producing steam.\nConventional Incineration\nThe basic arrangement of the conventional incinerator is shown in Figure 11-18. Although the solid waste may have some heat value, it is normally quite wet and is not autogenous  (self-sustaining in combustion) until it is dried. Conventionally, auxiliary \nfuel is provided for the initial drying stages. Because of the large amount of particulate matter generated in the combustion process, some form of air pollution control device is required. Normally, electrostatic precipitators or scrubbers are chosen. Bulk volume reduction in incinerators is about 90 per"}
{"text": "cent. Thus, about 10 percent of the material still must be carried to a landfill.\nRecovering Energy from Waste\nIn order to utilize the heat value of solid waste, most modern combustion devices are designed to recover the energy. The concept is more than 100 years old. The first refuse-to-electricity system was built in Hamburg, Germany, in 1896. In 1903, the first of several solid waste-fired electricity generating plants in the United States was  installed in New York City. There are now many WTE plants operating in the United States. They burn solid waste in a specially designed incinerator furnace jacketed with water-filled tubes to  recover the heat as steam. The steam may be used directly for heating or to produce electricity.dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 835  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 835  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles836  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n Many states require public utilities to buy the electricity produced at these plants. \nWith efficient heat recovery and electric generators, WTE plants can produce about 600 kWh per mg of waste.\nRefuse-Derived Fuel (RDF).  Refuse-derived fuel is the combustible portion of solid \nwaste that has been separated from the noncombustible portion through processes such as shredding, screening, and air classifying (Vence and Powers, 1980). By process"}
{"text": "ing municipal solid waste (MSW), refuse-derived fuel containing 12 to 16 MJ/kg can be produced from between 55 and 85 percent of the refuse received. This system is also called a supplemental fuel system because the combustible fraction is typically marketed as a fuel to outside users (utilities or industries) as a supplement to coal or other solid fuels in their existing boilers. In a typical system, MSW is fed into a trommel or rotating screen to remove glass and dirt, and the remaining fraction is conveyed to a shredder for size reduction. Shred-ded wastes may then pass through an air classifier to separate the \u201clight fraction\u201d  (plastics, paper, wood, textiles, food wastes, and smaller amounts of light metals) from the \u201cheavy fraction\u201d (metals, aluminum, and small amounts of glass and ceramics). The light fraction, after being routed through a magnetic system to remove ferrous metals, is ready for fuel use. The heavy fraction is conveyed to another magnetic  removal system for recovery of ferrous metals. Aluminum may also be recovered. The remaining glass, ceramics, and other nonmagnetic materials from the heavy fraction are then sent to the landfill. The first full-scale plant to prepare RDF has been in operation in Ames, Iowa, since 1975. Subsequently, other plants using similar technology have been designed and constructed.

Their modularity \nenables them to be coupled with similar units to process available tonnage. Most modular incinerators that produce energy incorporate a controlled air prin-ciple, use unprocessed MSW, and require a small amount of auxiliary fuel for startup. The waste is fed into a primary chamber where it is burned in the absence of sufficient oxygen for complete combustion. The resulting combustible gas passes through a sec-ond chamber, where excess air is injected, completing combustion. Auxiliary fuel may also be required in minimal quantities to maintain proper combustion temperatures. After most of the particulate matter burns off, the hot effluent passes through a waste heat boiler to produce steam. The ash is water-quenched and disposed of at a landfill. T"}

The second approach is to utilize sophisticated air pollu-tion control equipmen"}
{"text": "t. A second problem is associated with the ash from the combustion process. There are two categories of ash generated: fly ash from the air pollution control equipment and bottom ash from the furnace. Fly ash is of greater concern because the metals are adsorbed on particulates and are easily leached with water. When fly ash is mixed with bottom ash, the leachability of the metals is reduced. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that ash from municipal incinerators is not excluded from being considered as a haz-ardous waste (Chicago vs. EDF, 1994). It must be tested before it can be landfilled and must be treated if it fails the tests.\n11-6 RESOURCE CONSERV ATION AND RECOVERY \nFOR SUSTAINABILITY\nBackground and Perspective\nThe earth\u2019s prime mineral deposits are limited. As high-quality ores are depleted, lower-grade ores must be used. Lower-grade ores require proportionately greater amounts of energy and capital investment to extract. In a broad economic context, we should view with concern the long-term reasonableness of a market-accounting system that applies only current development costs to our use of depletable, nonrenewable natural resources such as aluminum, copper, iron, and petroleum. High rates of solid waste production imply high rates of virgin raw material extraction. In the United States, blatant mispricing\u2014including the \u201cdepletion allowance\u201d on minerals and un-reasonably low rail rate fares on ores in contrast to scrap\u2014is in no small way respon-sible for this state "}
{"text": "of affairs. Furthermore, our high-waste, low-recycle lifestyle is inherently wasteful of a bountiful endowment of natural resources. Our renewable resources, primarily timber, are also under siege. Our prepackaged society, in combination with a wanton lack of care in our forests, has strained nature\u2019s capacity for growth and replenishment. Europe, India, and Japan have long been faced with a want of timber. We in the United States should learn from their predicaments. The prevention of waste generation (resource conservation) and the productive use of waste material (resource recovery) represent means of alleviating some of the problems of solid waste management. At one time in our history, resource recovery played an important role in our industrial production. Until the mid-twentieth cen-tury, salvage (recovery and recycling) from household wastes was an important source of materials. In the five years preceding 1939, recycled copper, lead, alumi-num, and  paper supplied 44, 39, 28, and 30 percent, respectively, of the total raw materials shipments to fabricators in the United States (NCRR, 1974). Ultimately, it became more economical to process virgin materials than to use recovered materials. In principle, processable municipal solid waste could provide 95 percent and 73 percent of our nation\u2019s needs in glass and paper, respectively. EPA estimates that overall, 30 percent of municipal solid waste was recovered in 2003. This represents an increasing trend. Table 11-12 show"}

In 2003, 65.7 Tg million tons of waste were diverted \nfrom landfills by recycling and composting.

About 44 percent of aluminum beverage cans were recycled, as well as 48 percent of paper and paperboard, 22 percent of glass containers, and 8 percent of plastic packaging and containers. Newspapers, the most recycled product, were recycled at a rate of about 82 percent, while used telephone books were recycled at a rate of only 16 percent. Recycling of municipal solid waste for profit or for energy recovery is rarely cost-effective. However, many communities have initiated recycling programs as a means of protecting the environment. Citizens have become increasingly aware of their role in protecting the natural environment, and so demand that communities offer recycling services. EPA has also set national goals to encourage active resource conservation and recovery programs. Most states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws on recyclin"}
{"text": "g ranging from purchasing preferences to comprehensive recycling goals. Over 8,000 curbside recycling programs, 3,000 composting programs, and 200 municipal recycling facilities are in operation (Wolpin, 1994, and U.S. EPA, 2003). The recyclable market continues to fluctuate dramatically. For example, the price of old newsprint fell from $50/Mg in 1988 to less than $10/Mg in 1993 (Rogoff and Williams, 1995). It rose to over $100/Mg in 1995 (Paul, 1995). The remainder of our discussion will be devoted to the technical details of several of the more promising resource conservation and recovery (RC & R) techniques. We have divided these into three broad categories entitled low technology, medium tech-nology, and high technology. These categories refer to increasing degrees of sophisti-cation in terms of implementation, equipment, and capital investment. No municipal government should be enticed into any one of these schemes with the hope of making money. The best that can be hoped for is defraying the additional costs over conven-tional landfilling and extending the life of the landfill by some modest amount. In some cases, even these modest goals may not be achieved.TABLE 11-12\nGeneration, materials recovery, composting, and discards of municipal solid waste, 1960\u20132003\na, b\n 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2003\nGeneration 80.1 110.1 137.8 186.6 212.8 214.8\nRecovery for recycling 5.1 7.3 13.2 26.4 47.6 50.4Recovery for composting\nc    3.8 15.0 15.4\nTotal materials recovery 5.1 7.3 13.2"}

In Oregon, a reduction in total roadside litter of 39 percent by item count and 47 percent by volume was reported after the second year of im-plementation of its law. Furthermore, for glass containers there is a significant en-ergy savings in that a glass bottle reused 10 times consumes less than one-third of the energy of a single-use container. Average reuse cycles vary from 10 to 20 times per container.\nRecycling.  The reprocessing of wastes to recover an original raw material was for-\nmerly called salvage and is now called recycling. At its lowest and most appropriate technological level, the materials are separated at the source by the consumer (source-separation ). This is the most appropriate level because it requires the minimum expen-\nditure of energy. With stringent goals for recycling, municipalities are looking at detailed recycling options. Generally, the recycling options available to a municipality for residential use include:\nCurbside collection\nDrop-off centersMaterial processing facilityMaterial transfer stationsLeaf/yard waste compostBulky waste collection and processingTire recovery\n The primary method of recycling in the United States today is curbside collec-\ntion. This has the advantage of being easier on the resident than having to drive to a recycling center. There are two basic types of curbside collection for recycling. In the first, the homeowner is"}
{"text": " given a number of bins or bags. The homeowner sepa-rates the refuse as it is used, placing it in the appropriate bin. On collection day the container is placed on the curb. The primary disadvantage of supplying home stor-age containers is the cost, which can represent a significant investment. A second method of curbside recycling is to provide the homeowner with only one bin, into which is placed all the  recyclable materials. Curbside personnel then separate material dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 841  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 841  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles842  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nas it is being picked up, placing each type of material into a separate compartment \nin the vehicle. A second alternative is a drop-off center. Because recycling is a community-specific operation, a drop-off system must be designed around and in consideration of conditions particular to the area of involvement. To evaluate and select the most ap-propriate drop-off system, we must consider critical factors such as location, materials handled, population, number of centers, operation, and public information. When drop-offs are used to supplement curbside programs, fewer and smaller drop-off sites may be required. When drop-off sites are the only, or primary, recycling system in a community, the system must"}
{"text": " provide for increased capacity. Careful planning to ac-commodate traffic flow, as well as storage and collection of materials, must be part of the siting activity. The convenience of a drop-off center will directly affect the amount of citizen participation. Strategically locating a drop-off center in an area of high traffic flow, where the center is highly visible, will encourage a greater level of participation. Even rural areas with widely scattered populations provide good locations for drop-offs. Rural homeowners have certain common travel patterns that bring them to a few locations at regular intervals\u2014to a grocery store, church, or post office, to name a few. Figure 11-20 shows an example of a drive-through material recycling center. A third major type of recycling is a materials recovery facility. In this case the re-cyclable material is taken by the municipality to a central facility where the material is separated via mechanical and labor-intensive means. Figure 11-21 shows an example layout of a separation facility and Figure 11-22 shows a mass balance of what can be expected at such a facility.\nFIGURE 11-20\nEnclosed drive-through drop-off center.Aluminum\ncansBi-metal\ncansClear\nglassGreen glassBrown glassPlasticsPlastics\nCashier\nofficeCorrugatedMixed\npaperDrive-Thru\nPlan viewScale Bundled\nnewspaperdav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 842  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 842  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/"}

However, their use can be encouraged, and purchases can be made that support those who use environmentally conservative packages and products.\nShredding and Separation.  As a first step in a medium technology system or as an \nadd-on to a landfill volume enhancement program, some materials may be reclaimed at a central processing point. The most likely candidates for recycling are paper, non-ferrous metals (for example, aluminum), and ferrous metals. Paper generally is re-moved by hand as the MSW passes along on a conveyor belt.* After passing through a shredder, ferrous metals can be removed using a magnetic separator. In large commu-nities, where more than 1,000 Mg/wk of MSW is collected, some consideration may \n*Depending upon the economy, hand sorting may be a losing proposition. An average worker can pick about \n2.0 Mg of newspaper in an eight-hour day. At a wage of $5.50/h, a day\u2019s wages amount to $44.00, exclusive of overhead and fringe benefits.

Of course, in 1995, when the price was $116/Mg, it was a winning proposition.Glass sorting Residue 3%\nMixedGreenAmberFlint\n11%Aluminum 3%14% 17% 17%\nPlastics .3%\nBimetalTin2%\nNewspaper 33%\nOffice, computer 18%Corrugated 24%Magnetic\nseparatorInput 19%\nmixed glass,\nmetal &\nplastics\nBalerInput 81%\ntotal\npaper\nResidue 6%\nFIGURE 11-22\nMaterial recovery facility process mass flow.dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 844  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 844  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesSOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT   845\nbe given to the separation and shredding of auto and truck tires. Asphaltic concrete \nplants may be able to use the shredded tires in their raw material feedstock. Because tires are troublesome at landfills (because no matter how deep they are buried, they often pop up to the surface), their recovery as a resource is doubly beneficial.\nComposting.  Compost is a humus-like material that results from the aerobic bio-\nlogical stabilization of the organic materials in solid waste. The most effective com-posting occurs when the waste stream is free of inorganic materials. Frequently, this makes source-separated yard waste ideal. For the biological"}
{"text": " process to be effective, the following conditions must be met (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993).\n 1. Particle size must be small (, 5 cm).\n 2. Aerobic conditions must be maintained by turning the compost pile or forcing \nair through it.\n 3. Adequate, but not excessive, moisture must be present (50 to 60 percent).\n 4. An adequate population of acclimated microorganisms must be present.\n 5. The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio must be in the range of 20\u201325 to 1.\n The biodegradation process is exothermic and a well-operating compost will have \na temperature between 55 and 608 C during the period of active degradation. These \ntemperatures are effective in destroying pathogens. The processing cycle for compost-ing is about 20 to 25 days with active degradation taking place over a 10- to 15-day period. One of the major drawbacks of composting is odors. Maintenance of aerobic conditions and a proper cure time minimize odor problems. Compost is useful as a soil conditioner. In this role compost will: (1) improve soil structure, (2) increase moisture-holding capacity, (3) reduce leaching of soluble nitro-gen, and (4) increase the buffer capacity of the soil. It should be emphasized that com-post is not a valuable fertilizer. It contains only 1 percent or less of the major nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash. Composting is one of the fastest-growing aspects of ISWM. The driving force is legislation enacted to extend the life of landfills by removing yard waste from the waste stream"}
{"text": ". According to the EPA, recovery by composting was negligible in 1988. By 1990, EPA estimated that 2 percent of the nation\u2019s solid waste was being compos-ted. The 2000 estimate was that 7 percent of the solid waste was being composted. In 1994, over 3,000 composting facilities were operating in the United States. Sludge composting facilities numbered over 180, and municipal solid waste composting was being practiced by 21 cities (Monk, 1994).\nMethane Recovery.  Methane is produced in sanitary landfills as a result of anaerobic \ndecomposition of the organic fraction of the waste. In addition to gas extraction wells and a collection system, some gas processing equipment is employed. The minimum processing consists of dehydration, gas cooling, and, perhaps, removal of heavy hydro-carbons. The gas produced is a low-Joule gas having heating value of 18.6 MJ/m\n3. In \nhigh-Joule processing systems,  carbon dioxide and some hydrocarbons are removed to yield essentially pure methane. The resulting gas is of pipeline quality and has a heating dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 845  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462dav01145_ch11_785-865.indd Page 845  10/25/11  11:12 AM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles846  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nvalue of approximately 37.3 MJ/m3. The anticipated quantity of landfill gas (LFG) varies \nbetween 0.6 and 8.7 liters per kilogram of solid "}
{"text": "waste present per year (L/kg ? y). The \naverage production rate is 5 L/kg ?  y.\n Although landfill sites as small as 11 ha have yielded substantial quantities of re-\ncoverable methane, the capital investment and complexity of the gas processing equip-ment will limit this technique to the larger sites ( .65 ha). Otherwise, the technology \nis readily available and can make use of a resource that otherwise would dissipate into the atmosphere. According to EPA data, in 1999, 360 LFG-recovery projects nation-wide produced the equivalent of 1,200 MW of power (Skinner, 1999).\nHigh Technology RC & R\nIn the mid-1970s, under the auspices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and with federal financing, several innovative high technologies for resource recovery were examined. At the end of the decade, a few workable systems and a large number of unworkable systems were identified. Because the successful high technology systems depend, to a large measure, on the recovery of energy for their success, we will consider the worth of solid waste as a fuel. As illustrated in Table 11-14, MSW is not a very good fuel. On the other hand, its cost of $0.00/Mg may seem quite attractive. This is especially so when the price of  anthracite coal may be $50/Mg and the price of No. 2 fuel oil is $250/Mg. Unfortunately, solid \nTABLE 11-14\nNet heating value of various materials\nMaterial Net heating value (MJ/kg)\nCharcoal 26.3\nCoal, anthracite 25.8\nCoal, bituminous (hi volatile B) 28.5\nFuel oil, no.

Unless the physical characteristics are upgraded by \nremoving metals and glass and by reducing the particle size, MSW cannot be burned in conventional coal-fired power plants. The alternative is the construction of a special power plant that can handle the MSW as it is received. In either case, some cost is imposed. It appears that if a high technology resource recovery facility is to be successful, it must meet the following criteria (Serper, 1980):\n 1. High technology resource recovery can only be economical in large metropolitan \nareas where landfill sites are unavailable or are very expensive, above $25/Mg, or \nin geographic locations where the water table makes safe landfilling impossible, as, for example, the city of N"}
{"text": "ew Orleans and its surrounding suburbs.\n 2. There must be an adequate refuse supply committed to the facility (a minimum \nof 1.8 Gg/d is needed). In general, this implies a population of 250,000 or more.\n 3. A customer must be obtained for the steam or the power generated by the \nplant and must be located close by. Firm contracts must be obtained for both the refuse supply and the sale of energy.\n 4. If the customer is totally dependent on the energy supplied by the facility, the \ncombustion facility must be designed with the capacity to burn fossil fuel when refuse is unavailable or when the plant cannot process the raw refuse due to malfunctions of the processing equipment.\n 5. The logistics of delivering refuse to the resource recovery facility should be \nplanned long in advance. It may be necessary to establish transfer stations and storage locations that will operate in conjunction with the resource recovery plant.\n 6. Systems that can dispose of both municipal refuse and sewage sludge will have \neconomic advantages over systems that dispose of refuse only. With the ban of ocean dumping now in effect, local sewage districts are being forced to spend astronomical amounts of money to incinerate sludge. A co-disposal plant should reduce both the refuse and sludge disposal costs. In order to be economically competitive, sewage sludge must be dewatered to the maximum practical extent. A number of co-disposal plants are now in operation in Europe. Except for large installation"}

The following paragraphs \npresent a summary of what these compounds are, where they come from, and their environmental impact. Dioxins are found as over twenty different isomers of a basic chlorodioxin structure (Figure 12-1). The most common form, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), has become recognized as probably the most poisonous of all synthetic chemicals. Dioxins are a contaminant by-product that may be thermally generated during the manufacture or burning of chlorophenols; pesticides such as 2,4,5-T; Agent Orange, a defoliant made of a 50/50 mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T; algae-controlling herbicides; in-secticides; and preservatives. Dioxins are not manufactured for "}
{"text": "any commercial pur-pose. They occur only as a contaminant by-product. To date no dioxin has been found to be formed naturally in the environment. Widespread TCDD contamination has been reported in particulate matter from commercial and domestic combustion processes. Additional background dioxin contamination (0.1 to 10 parts per million, ppm) may persist and bioaccumulate following the field application of herbicides. TCDD is a crystalline solid at room temperature. It is only slightly soluble in water (0.2 to 0.6 parts per billion, ppb). TCDD is considered to be a highly stable compound. It is thermally degraded at temperatures over 700 8C. It is photochemically degraded \nunder ultraviolet light in the presence of a hydrogen-donating solvent such as a solution of olive oil in cyclohexanone. TCDD contamination was found at ppm levels in 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D used for weed control in the United States and as a defoliant in Vietnam; in wastes at the Love Canal disposal sites; in orthochlorophenol crude spill residues in the Sturgeon, Missouri, train derailment; and in fallout from an explosion at a chlorophenol manufacturing plant spill in Seveso, Italy. It is at this last site that engineers and scientists were challenged to develop environmentally safe control strategies.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 867  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 867  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ"}
{"text": "302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles868  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The environmental health effects of dioxin in people are not well documented. How-\never, alleged birth defects in newborns in South Vietnam caused researchers to begin animal toxicological investigations. TCDD is known to cause severe skin disorders, such as chloracne. In test animals it is a carcinogen, teratogen, mutagen, and embryo-toxin, and is known to affect immune responses in mammals. It is considered persistent, and it bioaccumulates in aquatic organisms and people (U.S. EPA, 2005a). At this date (2011) no deaths have been directly correlated with low-level TCDD exposure. Nor have epide-miological findings shown any increased incidence of carcinogenesis, teratogenesis, mu-tagenesis or newborn defects, miscarriages, or similar adverse health effects in people. In 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report compiled by more than 100 scientists, including many not affiliated with EPA, that presents evidence that dioxin, even in trace amounts, may cause adverse human health effects (Hileman, 1994). EPA believes that dioxins are carcinogens and may cause a wide range of other effects including disruption of regulatory hormones, reproductive and immune system disorders, and abnormal fetal development (U.S. EPA, 2001 and 2005a). Levels of dioxins in the environment were negligible until about 1930, peaked about 1970, and \nFIGURE 12-1\nSome examples of"}

Concentrations of dioxins in human lipid tissue have \ndeclined since 1980. The term PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) refers to a class of organic chemicals pro-duced by the chlorination of a biphenyl molecule. It is composed of ten possible forms and, theoretically, more than 200 isomers. These forms arise from a specified number of chlo-rine substitutions on the biphenyl molecule and correspond to the chemical nomenclatures monochlorobiphenyl, dichlorobiphenyl, trichlorobiphenyl, and so on. Several isomers for each PCB molecule are possible, the number depending on available substitution sites on each biphenyl portion (2\u20136, 2926 9) of the molecule. However, not all possible isomers are \nlikely to be formed during the manufacturing processes. In general, the most common ones are those that have either an equal number of chlorine atoms on both rings or a difference of only one chlorine atom between rings. Some examples are shown in Figure 12-2. Commercial PCB mixtures were manufactured under a variety of trade names. The chlorine content of any product varied from 18 to 79 percent, depending on the extent of chlorination during the manufacturing p"}

For example, Aroclor 1248, 1254, and 1260 indicate 48 percent, 54 percent, and 60 percent chlorine, respectively; Clophen A60, Phenochlor DP6, and Kaneclor 600 designate that these products contain mix-tures of hexachlorobiphenyls. The only important U.S. producer of PCBs was Monsanto Industrial Chemicals Co., which had plants at Anniston, Alabama, where production of PCBs ended in 1970; and Sauget, Illinois, where production ceased in 1977. Sold under Monsanto\u2019s re gistered trade-mark of Aroclors, mixtures of PCBs had been used originally as a coolant/dielectric for transformers and capacitors, as heat transfer fluids, and as protective coatings for woods \nFIGURE 12-2\nMolecular structure and names of a few selected polychlorinated biphenyls.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 869  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 869  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles870  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nwhen low flammability was essential or desirable. Producers and users alike, apparently \nunaware of any potential hazards from exposure to PCBs, initially operated in accordance with earlier results of toxicity tests that indicated no effects (Penning, 1930). The expansi"}
{"text": "on of open-ended applications between 1930 and 1960, incorporating PCBs into such com-modities as paints, inks, dedusting agents, and pesticides, led to the widespread dissemina-tion of which we are now aware. By 1937, toxic effects were noted in occupationally exposed workers, and threshold limit values were imposed at manufacturing sites. The general pattern of release of PCBs to the environment changed significantly during the early 1970s. Until then, essentially no restrictions were imposed either on the use or on the disposal of PCBs. After evidence became available in 1969 and 1970 that chronic exposure could result in hazards to human health and the environment, Monsanto voluntarily banned sales of PCBs, and the release rate from industrial use was reduced through stringent control measures. However, significant reservoirs of mobile PCBs (those available for transport among environmental media and biota) still exist along with even larger, currently immobile reservoirs. The latter include those materials containing PCBs that are still in service and those deposited in landfills and dumps. The major factor affecting future release of PCBs from these sources will be government regulations controlling storage and disposal of the chemical.\n12-2 DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF \nHAZARDOUS WASTE\nThere are two ways a waste material is found to be hazardous ( Code of Federal Regula-\ntions, 40 CFR 260): (1) by its presence on the EPA-developed lists, or (2) by evidence that the"}
{"text": " waste exhibits ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic characteristics.\nEPA\u2019s Hazardous Waste Designation System\nThe list of hazardous wastes includes spent halogenated and nonhalogenated solvents; electroplating baths; wastewater treatment sludges from many individual production processes; and heavy ends, light ends, bottom tars, and side-cuts from various distilla-tion processes. Some commercial chemical products are also listed as being hazardous wastes when discarded. These include \u201cacutely hazardous\u201d wastes such as arsenic acid, cyanides, and many pesticides, as well as \u201ctoxic\u201d wastes such as benzene, toluene, and phenols. EPA has designated five hazardous waste categories. Each hazardous waste is given an EPA Hazardous Waste Number. This is often referred to as the Hazardous Waste Code. Each of the five categories may be identified by the prefix letter assigned by EPA. The five categories may be described as follows:\n 1. Specific types of wastes from nonspecific sources; examples include haloge-\nnated solvents, nonhalogenated solvents, electroplating sludges, and cyanide \nsolutions from plating batches. (There are 28 listings in this category. See 40 CFR 261.31.) These wastes have a waste code prefix letter F.\n 2. Specific types of wastes from specific sources; examples include oven residue \nfrom the production of chrome oxide green pigments and brine purification dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 870  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 870  10/2"}

Any commercial chemical product or intermediate, off-specification product, or \nresidue that has been identified as an acute hazardous waste. Examples include potassium silver cyanide, toxaphene, and arsenic oxide. (There are approxi-mately 203 listings in this category. See 40 CFR 261.33.) These wastes have a waste code prefix letter P.\n 4. Any commercial chemical product or intermediate, off-specification product, or \nresidue that has been identified as hazardous waste. Examples include xylene, DDT, and carbon tetrachloride. (There are approximately 450 listings in this category. See 40 CFR 261.33.) These wastes have a waste code prefix letter U.\n 5. Characteristic wastes (40 CFR 261.21 through 40 CFR 261.27), which are \nwastes not specifically identified elsewhere, that exhibit properties of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. These wastes have a waste code prefix letter D.\n The wastes that appear on one of the lists specified in items one through four are called listed wastes. The current list may be found at www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr.* Those \nwastes that "}
{"text": "are declared hazardous because of their general properties are called characteristic wastes. The characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity may be referred to as ICR. The toxicity characteristic may be referred to as TC.\nIgnitability\nA solid waste is said to exhibit the characteristic of ignitability if a representative sample of the waste has any of the following properties:\n 1. It is a liquid, other than an aqueous solution containing less than 24 percent \nalcohol by volume, and has a flash point less than 608C\n\u2020.\n 2. It is not a liquid and is capable, under standard temperature and pressure, of \ncausing fire through friction, absorption of moisture, or spontaneous chemical \nchanges; and, when ignited, burns so vigorously and persistently that it cre-ates a hazard.\n 3. It is an ignitable, compressed gas.\n 4. It is an oxidizer.\n A solid waste that exhibits the characteristic of ignitability is given an EPA Hazardous Waste Number of D001.\n*In 2005, the gpoaccess search engine would locate only 40 CFR 261. To find a subparagraph such as 40 CFR \n261.31, first search for 40 CFR 261, then scroll to the subparagraph of interest.\n\u2020Although it would seem to be a contradiction in terms, that is, calling a solid waste a liquid, Congress has done \nwhat was once only the province of the gods.

Of particular importance in the scheme are those things that are not included in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. For example, domestic sewage, certain nuclear material, household wastes, including toxic and hazardous materials, and small quantities (less than 100 kg/mo) are excluded from the RCRA regulations. This does not mean that these wastes are not regulated at all. In fact they are regulated under other statutes and, thus, do not need to be regulated under RCRA. Four important but controversial parts of the definition of a hazardous waste are the mixture rule, \u201ccontained in\u201d policy, \u201cderived from\u201d rule, and waste-code carry through principle. The mixture rule prevents dilution of waste for the purpose of escaping RCRA \nSubtitle C re"}
{"text": "gulation. Under 40 CFR 261.3(a)(2), mixtures of a listed hazardous waste and other solid wastes become hazardous wastes. In certain instances for char-acteristic wastes and in those cases where the listed waste is not to be land disposed, dilution is permitted. The dilution rules are summarized in 56 FR 3875, 31 JAN 1991. When the dilution rules apply, the mixture of a hazardous waste with the dilu-ent does not cause the diluent to become hazardous and may render the hazardous waste nonhazardous. A corollary to the mixture rule is the \u201c contained in\u201d policy. Under this policy, \nmedia such as soil and water are treated as hazardous wastes if they \u201ccontain\u201d listed hazardous wastes. Any solid waste generated from the treatment, storage, or disposal of a hazardous waste, including any sludge, spill residue, ash, emission-control dust, or leachate (but not precipitation run-off) is a hazardous waste (40 CFR 261.3(c)). This is known as the \u201c derived from\u201d rule. A corollary to the derived from and mixture rules is the \u201cwaste-code carry through\u201d principle. The principle states that a solid waste derived from a hazardous waste or a mixture of hazardous and nonhazardous waste contains all of the same waste codes as the original waste (53 FR 31138, 31148). Because of a legal suit and court order regarding the mixture rule, contained in policy, derived from rule, and waste-code carry through principle, EPA developed and proposed the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) (60 FR 66344"}
{"text": ", 12 DEC 1995). The proposed HWIR establishes exit levels for low-risk solid wastes that are designated as hazardous because they are listed, or have been mixed with, derived from, or contain a listed hazardous waste. If the constituents of the waste are below the exit levels, the waste may be disposed of as a nonhazardous (Subtitle D) waste. The Universal Waste Regulations (40 CFR 273) were developed by EPA to stream-\nline hazardous waste management standards for federal universal wastes (batteries, pesticides, thermostats, and lamps) that are widely generated. Batteries such as nickel-cadmium and small sealed lead-acid types, unused or banned pesticides, thermostats that contain mercury, and lamps such as fluorescent lights, neon, and mercury vapor that contain mercury or lead are considered universal wastes. The streamlining includes, \nfor example, provisions to extend the amount of time that businesses can accumulate wastes, to increase the amount of waste that can be accumulated, and to eliminate the need for a manifest.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 874  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 874  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesWhat Is a Waste?Industry\nEverything except your\nproduct is a waste.Wastewater Treatment Plant\nEverything coming out ofthe plant is a waste.\nWhat Is a \u201cRCRA\u201d Solid Waste?\nThe waste is not a \u201cRCRA\u201d "}

{"text": "Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (abbreviated HSWA and pronounced \u201chiss-wah\u201d). RCRA and HSWA were enacted to regulate the generation and disposal \nof hazardous wastes.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (abbreviated by CERCLA and pronounced \u201csir-klah\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cSuperfund,\u201d was enacted in 1980 to address these problems. SARA, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, extended the provisions of CERCLA. In the following sections, we shall attempt to tell you about the who, what, where, and how of RCRA, HSWA, CERCLA, and SARA.\nCradle-to-Grave Concept\nThe EPA\u2019s cradle-to-grave hazardous waste management system is an attempt to track hazardous waste from its generation point (the \u201ccradle\u201d) to its ultimate disposal point (the \u201cgrave\u201d). The system requires generators to attach a manifest (itemized list de-scribing the contents) form to their hazardous waste shipments. This procedure is designed to ensure that wastes are directed to, and actually reach, a permitted dis-posal site.\nGenerator Requirements\nGenerators of hazardous waste are the first link in the cradle-to-grave chain of hazardous waste management established under RCRA. Generators of more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste or 1 kilogram of acutely hazardous waste per month must (with a few exceptions) comply with all of the generator regulations.

Recordkeeping and reporting\nEPA assigns each generator a unique identification number. Without this number the \ngenerator is barred from treating, storing, disposing of, transporting, or offering for transportation any hazardous waste. Furthermore, the generator is forbidden from of-fering the hazardous waste to any transporter, or treatment, storage, or disposal (TSD) facility that does not also have an EPA ID number. Pretransport regulations are designed to ensure safe transportation of a hazard-ous waste from origin to ultimate disposal.

Identification of the characteristics and dangers associated with "}
{"text": "the wastes being \ntransported through labeling, marking, and placarding of the packaged waste.\nThese pretransport regulations only apply to generators shipping waste off-site. In addition to adopting the DOT regulations outlined above, EPA also developed pretransport regulations that cover the accumulation of waste prior to transport. A generator may accumulate hazardous waste on site for 90 days or less as long as the following requirements are met:\n 1. Proper storage: The waste is properly stored in containers or tanks marked \nwith the words \u201cHazardous Waste\u201d and the date on which accumulation began.\n 2. Emergency plan:  There is a contingency plan and emergency procedures for \nuse in an emergency.\n 3. Personnel training: Facility personnel are trained in the proper handling of hazardous waste.\nThe 90-day period allows a generator to collect enough waste to make transportation more cost effective, that is, instead of paying to haul several small shipments of waste, the generator can accumulate waste until there is enough for one big shipment. If the generator accumulates hazardous waste on-site for more than 90 days, it is considered an operator of a storage facility and must comply with requirements for such facilities. Under temporary, unforeseen, and uncontrollable circumstances, the 90-day period may be extended for up to 30 days by the EPA Regional Administrator on a case-by-case basis. There is an exception to this 90-day accumulation period that applies to generators"}

HSWA \nrequired, and the EPA developed, regulations that allow such generators to accumulate waste for 180 days (or 270 days if the waste must be shipped over 320 km) before they are considered the operator of a storage facility. The Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest (the manifest) is the key to cradle-to-grave waste management (see Figure 12-4). Through the use of a manifest, generators can track the movement of hazardous waste from the point of generation to the point of ultimate treatment, storage, or disposal. HSWA requires that each manifest certify that the generator has in place a pro-gram to reduce the volume and toxicity of the waste to the degree that is economically practicable, as determined by the generator, and that the treatment, storage, or disposal method chosen by the generator is the best practicable method currently available that minimizes the risk to human health and the environment.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 878  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 878  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesHAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT   879\nFIGURE 12-4\nUniform hazardous waste manifest.Please print or type.

{"text": " a transporter to the designated facility or from a transporter to an-other transporter, the manifest must be signed to acknowledge receipt of the waste. A copy of the manifest is retained by each link in the transportation chain. Once the waste is delivered to the designated facility, the owner or operator of the facility must send a copy of the manifest back to the generator. This system ensures that the genera-tor has documentation that the hazardous waste has made it to its ultimate destination. If 35 days pass from the date on which the waste was accepted by the initial trans-porter and the generator has not received a copy of the manifest from the designated facility, the generator must contact the transporter and/or the designated facility to determine the whereabouts of the waste. If 45 days pass and the manifest still has not been received, the generator must submit an exception report. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements for generators provide EPA and states with a method for tracking the quantities of waste generated and the movement of hazardous wastes.\nTransporter Regulations\nTransporters of hazardous waste are the critical link between the generator and the ultimate off-site treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste. The transporter regulations were developed jointly by EPA and the DOT to avoid contradictory re-quirements coming from the two agencies (U.S. EPA, 1986). Although the regulations are integrated, they are not contained under the sam"}
{"text": "e act. A transporter must comply with the regulations under 49 CFR 171-179 (The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act) as well as those under 40 CFR Part 263 (Subtitle C of RCRA). Even if generators and transporters of hazardous waste comply with all appro-priate regulations, transporting hazardous waste can still be dangerous. There is al-ways the possibility that an accident will occur. To deal with this possibility, the regulations require transporters to take immediate action to protect health and the environment if a release occurs by notifying local authorities and/or diking off the discharge area. The regulations also give officials special authority to deal with transportation ac-cidents. Specifically, if a federal, state, or local official, with appropriate authority, determines that the immediate removal of the waste is necessary to protect human health or the environment, the official can authorize waste removal by a transporter who lacks an EPA ID and without the use of a manifest.\nTreatment, Storage, and Disposal Requirements\nTreatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDs) are the last link in the cradle-to-grave hazardous waste management system. All TSDs handling hazardous waste must obtain an operating permit and abide by the treatment, storage, and disposal regulations. The TSD regulations establish performance standards that owners and operators must apply to minimize the release of hazardous waste into the environment.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 880"}

The purpose of these requirements is to assess the "}
{"text": "impact of a facility on the groundwater beneath it. Monitoring must be conducted for the life of the facility except at land disposal facilities, which must continue monitoring for up to 30 years after the facility has closed. The groundwater monitoring program outlined in the regulations requires a moni-toring system of four wells to be installed: one upgradient from the waste management unit and three downgradient. The downgradient wells must be placed so as to intercept any waste migrating from the unit, should such a release occur. The upgradient wells must provide data on groundwater that is not influenced by waste coming from the waste management unit (called background data). If the wells are properly located, comparison of data from upgradient and downgradient wells should indicate if con-tamination is occurring. Once the wells have been installed, the owner or operator monitors them for one year to establish background concentrations for selected chemicals. These data form the basis for all future data comparisons. There are three sets of parameters for which background concentrations are established: drinking water parameters, groundwater quality parameters, and groundwater contamination parameters. Closure is the period when wastes are no longer accepted, during which owners or operators of TSD facilities complete treatment, storage, and disposal operations, apply  final covers to or cap landfills, and dispose of or decontaminate equipment, structures, and soil. Po"}
{"text": "stclosure, which applies only to disposal facilities, is the 30-year period after closure during which owners or operators of disposal facilities conduct monitor-ing and maintenance activities to preserve and look after the integrity of the disposal system. Financial requirements were established to ensure that funds are available to pay for closing a facility, for rendering postclosure care at disposal facilities, and to compensate third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by sudden and nonsudden accidents related to the facility\u2019s operation (states and federal governments are ex-empted from abiding by these requirements). There are two kinds of financial require-ments: financial assurance for closure/postclosure and liability coverage for injury and property damage.\nLand Ban.  The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 signifi-\ncantly expanded the scope of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). HSWA was created, in large part, in response to strongly voiced citizen concerns that existing methods of hazardous waste disposal, particularly land disposal, were not safe. Section 3004 of the act sets restrictions on land disposal of specific wastes. This is commonly called the \u201cland ban,\u201d or land disposal restrictions  (LDR). As specifi-\ncally required by Section 3004(m), the agency established levels or methods of treat-ment, if any, which substantially reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from waste so that short"}

The only exception is where a spe-\ncial variance is approved based on a showing of no migration of hazardous constitu-ents from the land disposal site for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The last set of congressionally mandated standards was promulgated in accordance with the time-table on May 8, 1990. EPA has subsequently published revisions to clarify and stream-line the standards. The Universal Treatment Standards (UTS) are of particular note in this respect. Prior to 1994, treatment facilities managing hazardous waste often had to meet LDR treatment standards established for many different listed and characteristic wastes. In some cases, a constituent regulated to a given concentration level for one waste was also regulated in another waste at a different concentration level. On September 18, 1994, EPA published the UTS "}

On September 23, 1988, the EPA promulgated the final rules for underground storage tanks. There are a number of exclusions to the new regulations, including:\nHazardous waste UST systems\nRegulated wastewater treatment facilitiesAny equipment or machinery that contains regulated substances for operational \npurposes such as hydraulic lift tanks and electrical equipment tanks\nAny UST system of less than 415 litersAny UST system containing a de minimis (negligible) concentration of regu-\nlated substances\nAny emergency spill or overflow containment system that is expeditiously \nemptied after use\n All UST systems must have corrosion protection. There are three ways to obtain \ncorrosion protection for tanks: (1) construction of fiberglass-reinforced plastic, (2)steel- and fiberglass-reinforced plastic composite, or (3) a coated steel tank with cathodic protection. Cathodic protection systems must be regularly tested and inspected. All owners and operators must also provide spill and overfill prevention equipment and a certificate of installation to ensure that the methods of installation were in compliance with the regulations. Release (leak) detection must be instituted for all UST systems. Several different methods are allowed for"}

However, some systems have spe-cific requirements, for instance, a pressurized delivery system must be equipped with an automatic line leak detector and have an annual line tightness test.

As with any remediation situation, a corrective action plan may be required for long-term cleanups of contaminated soil and groundwater.\n12-4 CERCLA AND SARA\nThe Superfund Law\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \n(CERCLA) of 1980, better known as \u201cSuperfund,\u201d became law \u201cto provide for liability, compensation, cleanup and emergency response for hazardous substances released into "}
{"text": "the environment and the cleanup of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites.\u201d CERCLA was generally intended to give EPA authority and funds to clean up aban-doned w aste sites and to respond to emergencies related to hazardous waste. The law \nprovides for both response and enforcement mechanisms. The four major provisions of the law establish:\n 1. A fund (the \u201csuperfund\u201d) to pay for investigations and remedies at sites where \nthe responsible people cannot be found or will not voluntarily pay;\n 2. A priority list of abandoned or inactive hazardous waste sites for cleanup (the \nNational Priority List);\n 3. The mechanism for action at abandoned or inactive sites (the National Contin-\ngency Plan);\n 4. Liability for those responsible for cleaning up.\n Initially the trust fund was supported by taxes on producers and importers of pe-\ntroleum and 42 basic chemicals. In its first five-year period, Superfund collected about $1.6 billion, with 86 percent of that money coming from industry and the remainder from federal government appropriations. In 1986 the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) greatly expanded the money available to remediate Superfund sites. The fund was raised to $8.6 billion for a five-year period by taxing petroleum products ($2.75 billion), business income ($2.5 billion), and chemical feed-stocks ($1.4 billion). The remainder is from general revenues.\nThe National Priority List (NPL)\nThe NPL serves as a tool for the EPA to use in identifying sites tha"}

In September 2005 the list contained 1,239 sites (U.S. EPA, 2005b). The first NPL was formulated from notifi-cation procedures and existing information sources. Subsequently, a numeric ranking system known as the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) was developed. Sites with high HRS scores may be added to the list. Sites on the NPL are eligible for Superfund money. Those with lower scores are not likely to be eligible.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 884  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 884  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesHAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT   885\nThe Hazard Ranking System (HRS)\nThe HRS is a procedure for ranking uncontrolled hazardous waste sites in terms of \nthe potential threat based upon containment of the hazardous substances, route of release, characteristics and amount of the substances, and likely targets (40 CFR 300, Appendix A). The methodology of the HRS provides a quantitative estimate that represents the relative  hazards posed by a site and takes into account the poten-tial for human and environmental exposure to hazardous substances. The HRS score is based on the probability of contamination from four pathways\u2014groundwater, sur-face wa"}
{"text": "ter, soil, and air\u2014on the site in question. The groundwater and air migration pathways are evaluated for ingestion and  inhalation respectively. The surface water migration and soil exposure pathways are evaluated for multiple intake routes. Sur-face water is evaluated for (1) drinking water, (2) human food chain, and (3) envi-ronmental (contact) exposures. These exposures are evaluated for two separate migration components\u2014overland/flood migration and ground water to surface water migration. Soil is evaluated for potential exposure to the (1) resident population and (2) nearby population. Use of the HRS requires considerable information about the site and its surround-ings, the hazardous substances present, and the geology of the aquifers and the inter-vening strata. The factors that most affect an HRS site score are the proximity to a densely populated area or source of drinking water, the quantity of hazardous sub-stances present, and the toxicity of those hazardous substances. The HRS methodology has been criticized for the following reasons:\n 1. There is a strong bias toward human health effects, with only a slight chance \nof a site in question receiving a high score if it represents only a threat or haz-\nard to the environment.\n 2. Because of the human health bias, there is an even stronger bias in favor of \nhighly populated affected areas.\n 3. The air emission migration route must be documented by an actual release, \nwhile groundwater and surface water routes have no s"}
{"text": "uch documentation requirement.\n 4. The scoring for toxicity and persistence of chemicals may be based on site \ncontainment, which is not necessarily related to a known or potential release of the toxic chemicals.\n 5. A high score for one migration route can be more than offset by low scores for \nthe other migration routes.\n 6. Averaging of the route scores creates a bias against a site that has only one \nhazard, even though that one hazard may pose extreme threat to human health and the environment.\n The HRS scores range from 0 to 100, with a score of 100 representing the most hazardous site. Occasional exceptions have been made in the HRS priority ranking to meet the CERCLA requirement that a site designated by a state as its top priority be included on the NPL.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 885  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 885  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles886  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nThe National Contingency Plan (NCP)\nThe National Contingency Plan (NCP) provides detailed direction on the action to be \ntaken at a hazardous waste site, including initial assessment to determine if an emer-\ngency or imminent threat exists, emergency response actions, and a method to rank sites (the HRS) and establish priority for future action. When there is sufficient indica-tion that a site poses a potential ri"}
{"text": "sk to the environment, a detailed study is required. The NCP describes the steps to be taken for the detailed evaluation of the risks  associated with a site. Such an evaluation is termed a remedial investigation  (RI). \nThe process of selecting an appropriate remedy is termed the feasibility study (FS). \nThe remedial investigation and the feasibility study are often combined into a single  measure, known popularly as a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). The requirements of the RI/FS are usually outlined in a written work plan, which must be approved by the relevant federal and state agencies before it may be implemented. A remedial investigation includes the development of detailed plans that address the following items (40 CFR 300.400):\n 1. Site characterization: A description of the hydrogeological and geophysical \nsampling and analytical procedures to be applied in order to discover the na-ture and extent of the waste materials, the physical characteristics of the site, and any receptors that could be affected by the wastes at the site.\n 2. Quality control: The guidelines to be enforced to ensure that all the data col-lected from the characterization program are valid and satisfactorily accurate.\n 3. Health and safety: The procedures to be employed to protect the safety of the individuals who will work at the site and perform the site characterization.\nThe RI activities and subsequent evaluation of the data gathered are termed a risk assessment or an endang"}
{"text": "erment assessment. The remedial investigation report docu-ments the evaluation. The remedial investigation report serves as a basis for the feasibility study, which evaluates various remedial alternatives. The review criteria include: overall protection of human health and the environment; compliance with applicable or relevant and ap-propriate regulations; long-term effectiveness; reduction in toxicity, mobility, or vol-ume; short-term effectiveness; technical and administrative implementability; cost; state acceptance; and community acceptance. All the remedies selected must be capa-ble of reducing the risk at the hazardous waste site to an acceptable level. And, in general, the lowest-cost alternative that achieves this objective is chosen as the course of action. The results of the feasibility study are presented in a written report, called the record of decision (ROD). This document serves as a preliminary basis for the de-\nsign of the selected alternative. One of the keys to the National Contingency Plan is that it specifies that the de-gree of cleanup be selected in accordance with several criteria, including the  degree of hazard to the \u201cpublic health, welfare and the environment.\u201d Therefore, there is no predetermined level of remediation that can be required or that must be achieved at any site. Rather, the degree of correction is established on a site-by-site basis. What is acceptable in one location may not necessarily be acceptable in another.dav01145_ch12_866-954"}

To complete \nthe process, the actual construction and other activities are undertaken in accordance with the plans and specifications.\nLiability\nPerhaps the most far-reaching provision of CERCLA that has stood the test of the courts was the establishment of strict, joint and several liability  for cleanup of an NPL \nsite. Those identified by EPA as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) may include generators, present owners, or former owners of facilities or real property where haz-ardous wastes have been stored, treated, or disposed of, as well as those who accepted hazardous waste for transport and selected the facility. PRPs have strict liability; that is, liability without fault. Neither care nor negligence, neither good nor bad faith, \nneither knowledge nor ignorance, can be claimed as a defense. Congress correctly predicted that there would be instances where the PRPs would contest their contribu-tion to the problem and would, then, be unwilling to share the costs or the responsibil-ity. The strict liability provision orders that the PRP is liable "}

In other words, CERCLA is a \u201cpay now, argue later\u201d statute (O\u2019Brien & Gere, 1988). Although the language specific to \u201cjoint and several\u201d liability was removed from CERCLA, the courts have interpreted the law as though the language were included. This means that if a PRP contributed any wastes to a site, that PRP can be held ac-countable for all costs associated with the cleanup. This concept was strongly reaf-firmed in SARA. If the PRP refuses to pay, the federal government can sue to recover costs. These actions have been successful. In certain instances where those liable fail, without sufficient cause, to properly provide for cleanup, they may be liable for treble damages!\nSuperfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA)\nSARA reaffirmed and strengthened many of the provisions and concepts of the CERCLA program. In SARA, Congress clearly expressed a preference, but not a requirement, for remedies such as incineration or chemical treatment that render a waste nonhazardous rather than transport to another disposal site or simple contain-ment on site. SARA directs that the level of cleanup should achieve compliance with Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements  (ARARs). ARARs are environmental \nstandards from programs other than CERCLA and SARA. For example, if a state has a regulation regarding atmospheric emissions from incinerators, then a Su"}
{"text": "perfund cleanup using incineration must meet those applicable standards. Furthermore, if a similar standard appears to be relevant and appropriate, then EPA may elect to apply it. For example, if drums of waste found on an uncontrolled hazardous waste site have contents that appear to have the same constituents as F001-F005 spent solvent, then the UTS standards for RCRA waste may be considered relevant and appropriate even though there is no specific evidence to identify the origin of the waste.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 887  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 887  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles888  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n SARA significantly strengthens the requirement to consider damages to natural \nresources, especially those off-site.\nTitle III.  SARA includes a major addition to the provisions of CERCLA, namely \nTitle III\u2014Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know. Under the Emergency Planning provisions, facilities must notify the State Emergency Response Commission if they have quantities of extremely hazardous substances that exceed EPA specified Threshold Planning Quantities (TPQ). In addition, communities must establish Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) to develop a chemical emergency response plan. This plan must include identification of regulated facilities, emergency respo"}
{"text": "nse and notification procedures, training programs, and evacuation plans in case of a chemical release. If a facility accidentally releases chemicals that are on one of two lists [that is, EPA\u2019s Extremely Hazardous Substance list or the CERCLA Section 103(a) list], in regulated quantities (RQ), and the release has the potential for exposure off-site, they must notify the LEPC immediately. The law also requires a report on response actions taken, known or anticipated health risks, and advice on medical attention for exposed individuals. Perhaps the most revolutionary provision of Title III is the establishment of the Community\u2019s Right-to-Know  amounts of chemicals and their location in facilities in \ntheir community. Thus, information about potential hazards from chemicals is avail-able to the public. In addition, each year those facilities that release chemicals above specified threshold amounts must submit a Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) on an EPA-specified form (\u201cForm R\u201d). This inventory includes both accidental and routine re-leases, as well as off-site shipments of waste. The publication of these data has resulted in strenuous efforts by industry to control their previously unregulated and, hence, uncontrolled emissions because of the public outcry at the large quantities of materials being dumped into their environment.\n12-5 HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT\nA logical priority in managing hazardous waste would be to:\n 1.

Some firms set quantitative waste-minimization goals. Other firms are more qual-itative in their goal setting.\nWaste Audit.  An important first step in establishing a strategy for waste minimiza-\ntion is to conduct a waste audit. The audit should proceed stepwise:\n 1. Identify waste streams\n 2. Identify sources\n 3. Establish priority of waste streams for waste-minimization activity\n 4. Screen alternatives\n 5. Implement\n 6. Track\n 7. Evaluate progress\nThe key question that must be asked at the outset of a waste audit is \u201cwhy is this waste \nbeing generated?\u201d You must first establish the primary cause(s) of waste generation before attempting to find solutions. The audit should be waste stream\u2013oriented in order to produce a list of specific waste-minimization options for additional evaluation or implementation. Once the causes are understood, solution options can be formulated. An efficient materials and waste tracking system that allows computation of mass balances is useful in establishing priorities. Knowing how much material is going in and how much of it is ending up as waste allows you to decide which process and which waste to address first.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 889  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 889  10/25/11  1:30 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/d"}

The screening of options begins with source control. The source control investiga-tion should focus on (1) changes in input materials, (2) changes in process technology, and (3) changes in the human aspect of production. Input material changes can be classified into three separate elements: purification, substitution, and dilution.\n Purification of input materials is performed in order to avoid the introduction of inerts or impurities into the production process. Such an introduction results in waste because the process inventory must be purged in order to prevent the undesirable accumulation of impurities. Examples of purification of feed materials to lower waste generation include the use of deionized rinse water in electroplating or the use of oxygen instead of a ir in oxychlorination reactors for production of ethylene dichloride.\n Substitution is the replacement of a toxic material with one characterized by lower toxicity or higher environmental d"}
{"text": "esirability. Examples include using phosphates in place of dichromates as cooling water corrosion inhibitors or the use of alkaline cleaners in place of chlorinated solvents for degreasing. Dilution is a minor component of input material changes and is exemplified by use of more dilute plating solutions to minimize dragout (material carried out of one tank into another). Technology changes are those made to the physical plant. Examples include process changes, equipment, piping or layout changes, changes to process operational settings, additional automation, energy conservation, and water conservation. Procedural and/or institutional changes consist of improvements in the ways people affect the production process. Also referred to as \u201cgood operating practices\u201d or \u201cgood housekeeping,\u201d these include operating procedures, loss prevention, waste segregation, and material handling improvements.\nWaste Exchange\nWaste minimization by consignment of excess unused materials to an independent party for resale to a third party, saves both in waste production and in the cost (en-vironmental and financial) of production from new raw materials. In essence \u201cone  person\u2019s trash becomes another person\u2019s treasure.\u201d The difference between a manufac-turing by-product, which is costly to treat or dispose, and a usable or salable by-product involves opportunity, knowledge of processes outside the generator\u2019s immediate pro-duction line, and comparative pricing of virgin material.

The definition says that a material is recycled if it is used, reused, or reclaimed (40 CFR \n261.1 (c)(7)). A material is \u201cused or reused\u201d if it is either (1) employed as an ingredient (including its use as an intermediate) to make a product (however, a material will not dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 892  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 892  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesHAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT   893\nsatisfy this condition if distinct components of the material are recovered as separate end \nproducts, as when metals are recovered from metal-containing secondary materials); or (2) employed in a particular function as an effective substitute for a commercial product (40 CFR 261.1 (c)(5)). A material is reclaimed if it is processed to recover a useful prod-\nuct or if it is regenerated. Examples include the recovery of lead from spent batteries and the regeneration of spent solvents (40 CFR 261.1 (c)(4)) (U.S. EPA, 1988a). Distillation processes can be utilized to recover spent solvent. The principal char-acteristics that "}
{"text": "determine the potential for recovery are the boiling points of the various useful constituents and the water content. The more dilute the waste solvent, the less economical it is to recover. Recovered solvents can be reused by the generator or sold for at least a substantial fraction of the cost of virgin material, and the credit for recov-ered solvent can more than offset the cost of recovery. There are several technologies for recovery of metals from metal-plating rinse water. Most are applicable only to waste streams containing a single metal constituent. Examples include ion exchange, electrodialysis, evaporation, and reverse osmosis. In October 1988 a federal appeals court struck down an EPA policy not to list used oil collected for recycling as a hazardous waste. Prior to that ruling, PCB-contaminated oils, petroleum industry sludges, and leaded tank bottoms were the only oils regulated. The majority of oil and oily wastes generated were not classified as hazardous under EPA regulations. These wastes are amenable either to recovery for use as fuel or to refinement for use as lubricants. Although all waste oil is now deemed hazardous, those oils that were formerly recovered may still be recovered, but the requirements for tracking them are more stringent.\n12-6 TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES\nThe wastes that remain after the implementation of waste minimization must be de-toxified and neutralized. There are a large number of treatment technologies available to accomplish this. Man"}
{"text": "y of these are applications of processes we have discussed in earlier chapters. Examples include: biological oxidation (Chapter 8), chemical pre-cipitation, ion exchange, and oxidation-reduction (Chapter 6), and carbon adsorption (Chapter 9). Here we will discuss these as they apply to hazardous waste treatment, and we will introduce some new technologies.\nBiological Treatment\nIn contrast to naturally occurring compounds, anthropogenic compounds (those created \nby human beings) are relatively resistant to biodegradation. One reason is that the  organisms that are naturally present often cannot produce the enzymes necessary to bring about transformation of the original compound to a point at which the resultant interme-diates can enter into common metabolic pathways and be completely mineralized. Many environmentally important anthropogenic compounds are halogenated, and halogenation is often implicated as a reason for their persistence. The list of haloge-nated organic compounds includes pesticides, plasticizers, plastics, solvents, and  trihalomethanes. Chlorinated compounds are the best known and most studied because of the highly publicized problems associated with DDT and other pesticides and dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 893  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 893  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles894  INTRODUCTION TO "}
{"text": "ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nnumerous industrial solvents. Hence, chlorinated compounds serve as the basis for \nmost of the information available on halogenated compounds. Some of the characteristics that appear to confer persistence to halogenated com-pounds are the location of the halogen atom, the halide involved, and the extent of halogenation (Kobayashi and Rittman, 1982). The first step in biodegradation, then, is sometimes dehalogenation, for which there are several biological mechanisms. Simple generalizations do not appear to be applicable. For example, until recently, oxidative pathways were mostly believed to be the typical means by which haloge-nated compounds were dehalogenated. Anaerobic, reductive dehalogenation, either biological or nonbiological, is now recognized as the critical factor in the transforma-tion or biodegradation of certain classes of compounds. Compounds that require re-ductive dechlorination are common among the pesticides, as well as halogenated one- and two-carbon aliphatic compounds. Reductive dehalogenation involves the removal of a halogen atom by oxidation- reduction. In essence, the mechanism involves the transfer of electrons from reduced organic substances via microorganisms or a nonliving (abiotic) mediator, such as inor-ganic ions (for example, Fe\n31) and biological products (for example, NAD(P), flavin, \nflavoproteins, hemoproteins, porphyrins, chlorophyll, cytochromes, and glutathione). The mediators are responsible for accepting ele"}
{"text": "ctrons from reduced organic substances and transferring them to the halogenated compounds. The major requirements for the process are believed to be available free electrons and direct contact between the donor, mediator, and acceptor of electrons. Significant reductive dechlorination usually occurs only when the oxidation-reduction potential of the environment is 0.35 V and lower; the exact requirements appear to depend upon the compound involved (Kobayashi and Rittman, 1982). Although simple studies using pure cultures of microorganisms and single substrates are valuable, if not essential, for determining biochemical pathways, they cannot always be used to predict biodegradability or transformation in more natural situations. The in-teractions among environmental factors, such as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, temperature, pH, availability of other compounds, salinity, particulate matter, competing organisms, and concentrations of compounds and  organisms, often control the feasibility of biodegradation. The compound\u2019s physical or chemical characteristics, such as solubility, volatility, hydrophobicity, and octanol- water partition coefficient, con-tribute to the compound\u2019s availability in solution. Often compounds not soluble in the water are not readily available to organisms for biodegradation. There are some excep-tions. For example, DDT, which is only slightly soluble in water, may be degraded by the white rot fungus found on decaying trees. This is  "}
{"text": "because the enzymes involved in the white rot reaction are secreted from the cell (Kobayashi and Rittman, 1982). Simple culture studies are similarly inadequate for predicting the fate of sub-stances in the environment if there are many interactions between different organisms. First, substances that cannot be changed significantly in pure culture studies often will be degraded or transformed under mixed culture conditions. A good example of this type of interaction is cometabolism, in which a compound, the nongrowth substrate, is not metabolized as a source of carbon or energy, but is incidentally transformed by organisms using other compounds as growth substrates. The growth substrates provide the energy needed to cometabolize the nongrowth substrates.

For example, Hydrogenomonas can metabolize DDT only as far as p-chlorophenylacetic acid (PCPA), while Arthrobacter species can then remove the PCPA (Kobayashi and Rittman, 1982).

Such knowledge is necessary if limiting reactions are to be determined and the proper types of organisms selected for specific applications. More information about appropriate types of microorganisms to be selected and maintained in \u201creal-world\u201d treatment systems is needed, especially for the more novel microbial cultures. In order to develop special-purpose organisms by  genetic manipulation, major advances in the understanding of the genetic structure of the many different types of organisms in nature are needed. Conventional biological treatment processes such as activated sludge and trickling filters have been used to treat hazardous wastes. The major modification to the activated sludge processes has been to extend the mean cell residence time from the conventional values of 4 to 15 days to much longer periods of 3 to 6 months. In a similar fashion, trickling filter loading rates are much lower than those employed in municipal "}
{"text": "treatment systems. One innovation that has been adopted by TSD facilities is the sequencing batch \nreactor (SBR). The SBR is a periodically operated, fill-and-draw reactor (Herzbron et al., 1985). Each reactor in an SBR system has five discrete periods in each cycle: fill, react, settle, draw, and idle. Biological reactions are initiated as the raw wastewater fills the tank. During the fill and react phase, the waste is aerated in the same fashion as an activated sludge unit. After the react phase, the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) are allowed to settle. The treated supernatant is discharged during the draw phase. The idle stage, the time between the draw and fill, may be zero or may be a few days de-pending on wastewater flow demand. The SBR has a major advantage in that wastes may be tested for completeness of treatment before discharge.\nChemical Treatment\nChemical detoxification is a treatment technology, either employed as the sole treat-ment procedure or used to reduce the hazard of a particular waste prior to transport, incineration, and burial. It is important to remember that a chemical procedure cannot magically make a toxic chemical disappear from the matrix (wastewater, sludge, etc.) in which it is found, but can only convert it to another form. Thus, it is vital to ensure that the products of a chemical detoxification step are less of a problem than the starting material. It is equally important to remember that the reagents for such a reaction can be hazar"}

An optimum method would be fast, quantitative, in-expensive, and leave no residual reagent, which itself would be a pollution problem. The following paragraphs describe a few of these techniques.\nNeutralization.  Solutions are neutralized by a simple application of the law of mass \nbalance to bring about an acceptable pH. Sulfuric or hydrochloric acid is added to basic solutions, while caustic (NaOH) or slaked lime [Ca(OH)\n2] is added to acidic solutions. \nThough a waste is hazardous at pH values less than 2 or greater than 12.5, and it would seem that simply bringing the pH into the range 2 to 12.5 would be adequate, good treat-ment practice requires that final pH values be in the range 6 to 8 to protect natural biota.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 896  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 896  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesHAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT   897\nOxidation.  The cyanide molecule is destroyed by oxidation. Chlorine is the oxidiz-\ning agent most frequently used. Oxidation must be conducted under alkaline conditions to avoid the generation of hydrogen cyanide gas. This process is often referred to as alkaline chlorination. In chlorine oxidation, the reaction is carried out in two steps:\n NaCN 12NaO"}

In this step, great care must be taken to maintain relatively high pH values, because at lower pHs there is a potential for the evolution of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas. The second reaction step proceeds most rapidly around a pH of 8, but it is not as rapid as the first step. Higher pH values may be selected for the second step to reduce chemical consumption in the following precipitation steps. This increases the reaction time. Often the second reaction is not carried out because the CNO is considered nontoxic by current regulations. Ozone also may be used as the oxidizing agent. Ozone has a higher redox potential than chlorine, thus there is a higher driving force toward the oxidized state. When ozone is used, the pH considerations are similar to those discussed for chlorine. Ozone cannot be purchased. It must be made on-site as part of the process. This technology can be applied to a wide range of cyanide wastes: copper, zinc, and brass plating solutions; cyanide from cyanide salt heating baths; and passivating solutions. The process has been practiced on an industrial scale since the early 1940s. For extremely high cyanide concentrations ( .1 percent), oxidation may not be desir-\nable. Cyanide complexes of metals, particularly iron and to some extent nickel, cannot be decomposed"}
{"text": " easily by cyanide oxidation techniques. Electrolytic oxidation of cyanide is carried out by anodic electrolysis at high tem-peratures. The theoretical basis of the process is that cyanide reacts with oxygen in solution in the presence of an electric potential to produce carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas. Normally, the destruction is carried out in a closed cell. Two electrodes are sus-pended in the solution and a DC current is applied to drive the reaction. The bath tem-perature must be maintained in the range of 50 to 958C. This technology is used for the destruction of cyanide in concentrated spent strip-ping solutions; in plating solutions for copper, zinc, and brass; in alkaline descalers; and in passivating solutions. It has been more successful for wastes containing high concentrations of cyanide (50,000 to 100,000 mg/L), but it has also been successfully used for concentrations as low as 500 mg/L. Chemical oxidation methods for organic compounds in wastewater have received extensive study. In general they apply only to dilute solutions and often are considered expensive in comparison to the biological methods. Some examples include wet air  oxidation, hydrogen peroxide, permanganate, chlorine dioxide, chlorine, and ozone  oxidation. Of these, wet air oxidation and ozonation have shown promise as a pretreat-ment step for biological processes.

Air is bubbled \nthrough the liquid. The process is fuel efficient; once the oxidation reaction has started, it is usually self-sustaining. As this method is not limited by reagent cost, it is potentially the most widely applicable of all chemical oxidation methods. The method has been shown to be of use in destroying a wide range of organic  compounds, including some pesticides. Although wet oxidation can provide accept-able levels of destruction for many hazardous compounds, it generally is not as com-plete as incineration. In many instances, the addition of metal salt catalysts can increase the destruction efficiency or allow the process to be run at lower tempera-ture and/or pressure.\nPrecipitation.

The waste is not detoxified but only concentrated for further treatment or recovery.\nCarbon Adsorption.  Adsorption is a mass transfer process in which gas vapors or \nchemicals in solution are held to a solid by intermolecular forces (for example, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals\u2019 interactions). It is a surface phenomenon.

{"text": "rbon, molecular sieves, silica \ngel, and activated alumina are the most common adsorbents. The active sites become satu-rated at some point in time. When the organic material has commercial value, the bed is then regenerated by passing steam through it. The vapor-laden steam is condensed and the organic fraction is separated from the water. If the organic compounds have no commercial value, the carbon may be either incinerated or shipped to the manufacturer for regenera-tion. Carbon systems for recovery of vapor from degreasers and for polishing wastewater effluents have been in commercial application for over 20 years.\nDistillation.  The separation of more volatile materials from less volatile materials by \na process of vaporization and condensation is called distillation. When a liquid mixture \nof two or more components is brought to the boiling point of the mixture, a vapor phase is created above the liquid phase. If the vapor pressures of the pure components are dif-ferent (which is usually the case), then the constituent(s) having the higher vapor pres-sure will be more concentrated in the vapor phase than the constituent(s) having the lower vapor pressure. If the vapor phase is cooled to yield a liquid, a partial separation of the constituents will result. The degree of separation depends on the relative differ-ences in the vapor pressures. The larger the differences, the more efficient the separa-tion. If the difference is large enough, a single separation cycle of vap"}
{"text": "orization and condensation is sufficient to separate the components. If the difference is not large enough, multiple cycles (stages) are required. Four types of distillation may be used: batch distillation, fractionation, steam stripping, and thin film evaporation.* Both batch distillation and fractionation are well-proven technologies for recovery of solvents. Batch distillation is particularly applicable for wastes with high solids concentrations. Fractionation is applicable where multiple constituents must be sepa-rated and where the waste contains minimal suspended solids. When the volatility of the organic compound is relatively high and the concentration relatively low, then some form of stripping may be appropriate. Air stripping has been \nused to purge large quantities of contaminated groundwater of small concentrations of volatile organic matter. The behavior of the process is the inverse of absorption discussed in Chapter 9. Air and contaminated liquid are passed countercurrently through a packed tower. The volatiles evaporate into the air, leaving a clean liquid stream. The contami-nated air stream must then be treated to avoid an air pollution problem. Frequently this is accomplished by passing the air through an activated carbon column. The carbon is then incinerated. Air stripping has been used to remove tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethyl-ene, and toluene from water (Gross and TerMaath, 1985; U.S. EPA, 1987).

{"text": "f lower volatility or higher concentration ( .100 ppm) steam stripping \nmay be employed. The physical arrangement of the process is much like that of an air stripper, except that steam is introduced instead of air. The addition of steam enhances the stripping process by decreasing the solubility of the organic in the aqueous phase and by increasing the vapor pressure. Steam stripping has been used to treat aqueous waste contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons, xylenes, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methanol, and pentachlorophenol. Concentrations treated range from 100 ppm to 10 percent organic compound (U.S. EPA, 1987). Recovery of metals by evaporation is accomplished by boiling off sufficient water from the collected rinse stream to allow the concentrate to be returned to the plating bath. The condensed steam is recycled for use as rinse water. The boil-off rate, or evaporator duty, is set to maintain the water balance of the plating bath. Evaporation is usually performed under vacuum to prevent thermal degrada-tion of additives and to reduce the amount of energy required for evaporation of the water. There are four types of evaporators: rising film, flash evaporators using waste heat, submerged tube, and atmospheric pressure. Rising film evaporators are built so that the evaporative heating surface is covered by a wastewater film and does not lie in a pool of boiling wastewater. Flash evaporators are of similar configuration, but the plating solution is continuously rec"}
{"text": "irculated through the evaporator along with the wastewater. This allows the use of waste heat in the plating bath to augment the evapo-ration process. In the submerged tube design, the heating coils are submerged in the wastewater. Atmospheric evaporators do not recover the distillate for reuse and they do not operate under vacuum.\nIon Exchange.   Metals and ionized organic chemicals can be recovered by ion \n exchange. Ion exchange chemistry was discussed in Chapter 6. In ion exchange, the \nwaste stream containing the ion to be removed is passed through a bed of resin. The resin is selected to remove either cations or anions. In the exchange process, ions of like charge are removed from the resin surface in exchange for ions in solution. Typically, either hydrogen or sodium is exchanged for cations (metal) in solution. When the bed becomes saturated with the exchanged ion, it is shut down and the resin is regenerated by passing a concentrated solution containing the original ion (hydrogen or sodium) back through the bed. The exchanged pollutant is forced off the bed in a concentrated form that may be recycled.

As a rule, ion exchange systems are suitable for chemical recovery applications where the rinse water feed has a relatively dilute concentration ( , 1,000 mg/L) and a \nrelatively low concentration is required for recycle. Ion exchange has been demon-strated commercially for recovery of plating chemicals from acid-copper, acid-zinc, nickel, tin, cobalt, and chromium plating baths. The breakthrough curves for an ion-exchange column and an adsorption column (Chapter 9) are similar.

Normal operation then requires either an operating cycle that will allow regeneration of the spent resin during nonworking hours or, in the case of 24 hour, 7 day per week schedules, multiple beds so that one may be taken off-line. The diameters of ion exchange columns may vary from centimeters to 6 m. Resin bed depths range from 1 to 3 m. Bed height-to-diameter ratios range from 1.5:1 to 1:3. The column shell is designed to allow for 100 percent expansion of the resin bed dur-ing backwashing (regeneration). Columns are normally prefabricated and shipped by truck. Column height generally does not exceed 4 m. Multiple columns in series are provided where the design height exceeds 4 m.

The hydraulic loading may range from 25 to 600 m\n3/d ? m2. Lower hydraulic loadings \n result in longer contact periods and better exchange efficiency.

The membranes are thin sheets of ion exchange resin re-inforced by a synthetic fiber backing. The construction of the unit is such that anion membranes are alternated with cation membranes in stacks of cells in series (Figure 12-8). An electric potential is applied across the membrane to provide the motive force for ion migration. Cation membranes permit passage of only positively charged ions, \nwhile anion membranes permit passage of only negatively charged ions. The flow is directed through the membrane in two hydraulic circuits (Figure 12-9). One circuit is ion-depleted and the other is ion-concentrated. The degree of purification achieved in the dilute circuit is set by the electric potential. The ability to pass the charge is propor-tional to the concentration of the ionic species in the dilute stream. Because ion  migration is proportional to electric potential, the optimum system is a trade-off between energy requirements and degree of contaminant removal.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 907  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 907  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/00734"}

Osmosis is defined as the spontaneous transport of a solvent from a \ndilute solution to a concentrated solution across an ideal semipermeable membrane that impedes passage of the solute but allows the solvent to flow. Solvent flow can be reduced by exerting pressure on the solution side of the membrane, as shown in Figure 12-10. If the pressure is increased above the osmotic pressure on the solution side, the flow re-verses. Pure solvent will then pass from the solution into the solvent. As applied to metal finishing wastewater, the solute is the metal and the solvent is pure water. Many configurations of the membrane are possible. The driving pressure is on the order of 1,000 to 5,500 kPa. No commercially available membrane polymer has dem-onstrated tolerance to all extreme chemical factors such as pH, strong oxidizing agents, and aromatic hydrocarbons. However, selected membranes have been demonstrated on nickel, copper, zinc, and chrome baths.\nSolvent Extraction.  Solvent extraction is also called liquid ext"}

Contaminants can be removed from a waste stream using liquid- liquid extraction if the wastewater is contacted with a solvent having a greater solubility for the target contaminants than the wastewater. The contaminants will tend to migrate from the wastewater into the solvent. Although predominately a method for separating organic materials, it may also be applied to remove metals if the solvent contains a material that will react with the metal. Liquid ion exchange is one kind of these reactions.\nSemipermeable\nmembraneFresh\nwaterSaline\nwaterOsmosisOsmotic\nequilibrium\nOsmotic\npressureReverse\nosmosis Pressure\nFIGURE 12-10\nDirect and reverse osmosis.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 909  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 909  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles910  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n In the solvent extraction process, the solvent and the waste stream are mixed to \nallow mass transfer of the constituent(s) from the waste to the solvent. The solvent, immiscible in water, is then allowed to separate from the water by gravity. The solvent solution containing the extracted contaminant is called the extract. The extracted waste \nstream with the contaminants removed is called the raffinate. As in distillation, the \nseparation may need to be done in one or more stages. In ge"}
{"text": "neral, more stages result in a cleaner raffinate. The degree of complexity of the apparatus varies from simple mixer/settlers to more exotic contacting devices. If the extract is sufficiently enriched, it may be possible to recover useful material. Distillation is often employed to recover the solvent and reusable organic chemicals. For metal recovery, the ion exchange ma-terial is regenerated by the addition of an acid or alkali. The process has found wide application in the ore processing industry, in food processing, in pharmaceuticals, and in the petroleum industry.\nIncineration\nIn an incinerator, chemicals are decomposed by oxidation at high temperatures (8008C and greater). The waste, or at least its hazardous components, must be combustible in order to be destroyed. The primary products from combustion of organic wastes are carbon dioxide, water vapor, and inert ash. However, there are a multitude of other products that can be formed.\nProducts of Combustion.  The percentages of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, \nsulfur, halogens, and phosphorus in the waste, as well as the moisture content, need to be known to determine stoichiometric combustion air requirements and to predict combustion gas flow and composition. Actual incineration conditions generally re-quire excess oxygen to maximize the formation of products of complete combustion  \n(POCs) and minimize the formation of products of incomplete combustion (PICs). The incineration of halogenated organics results in "}
{"text": "the formation of halogenated acids, which require further treatment to ensure environmentally acceptable air emis-sions from the incineration process. Chlorinated organics are the most common halo-genated hydrocarbons found in hazardous waste. The incineration of chlorinated hydrocarbons with excess air results in the formation of carbon dioxide, water, and  hydrogen chloride. An example is the following reaction for the incineration of dichlorethane (Wentz, 1989):\n 2C\n2H4Cl215O2 S 4CO 212H2O14HCl (12-6)\nThe hydrogen chloride must be removed before the carbon dioxide and steam can be \nsafely exhausted into the atmosphere. Hazardous waste may contain either organic or inorganic sulfur compounds. When these wastes are incinerated, sulfur dioxide is produced. For example, the destruction of ethyl mercaptan results in the following reaction:\n 2C\n2H5SH19O2S4CO 216H2O12SO 2 (12-7)\nThe sulfur dioxide produced by the incineration of sulfur-containing wastes must not \nexceed air quality standards.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 910  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 910  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesHAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT   911\n Excess air must be provided to ensure complete combustion. However, the amount \nof the excess can only be determined empirically. For example, a highly volatile, clean, hydrocarbon waste would probabl"}
{"text": "y require much less excess air than would a heavy hydrocarbon sludge within a high solids content. Incineration of sludges and solids may require as much as two to three times excess air above stoichiometric equivalents. Too much excess air should be avoided because it increases the fuel required to heat the waste to destruction temperatures, reduces residence time for the hazardous wastes to be oxidized, and increases the volume of air emissions to be handled by the air pol-lution control equipment. By-products from the incineration of hazardous wastes may also result from  incomplete combustion as well as from the products of combustion. Products of in-complete combustion (PICs) include carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ke-tones, amines, organic acids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In a well- designed incinerator, these products are insignificant in amount. However, in poorly  designed or overloaded incinerators, PICs may pose environmental concerns. Polychlorinated biphenyls, for instance, decompose under such conditions into highly toxic chlorinated dibenzo furans (CDBF). The hazardous material, hexachlorocyclo-pentadiene (HCCPD), found in many hazardous wastes, is known to decompose into the even more hazardous compound hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (Oppelt, 1981). Suspended particulate emissions are also produced during incineration. These in-clude particles of mineral oxides and salts from the mineral constituents in the waste material, as well as frag"}
{"text": "ments of incompletely burned combustibles. Last, but not least, ash is a product of combustion. The ash is considered a hazard-ous waste. Metals not volatilized end up in the ash. Unburned organic compounds may also be found in the ash. When organic compounds remain, the ash may simply be in-cinerated. The metals must be treated prior to land disposal.\nDesign Considerations.   The most important factors for proper incinerator design \nand operation are combustion temperature, combustion gas residence time, and the ef-\nficiency of mixing the waste with combustion air and auxiliary fuel. Chemical and thermal dynamic properties of the waste that are important in deter-mining its time/temperature requirements for destruction are its elemental composi-tion, net heating value, and any special properties (for example, explosive properties) that may interfere with incineration or require special design considerations. In general, higher heating values are required for solids versus liquids or gases, for higher operating temperatures, and for higher excess air rates if combustion is to be sustained without auxiliary fuel consumption. While sustained combustion (autogenous combustion) is possible with heating values as low as 9.3 MJ/kg, in the \nhazardous waste incineration industry it is common practice to blend wastes (and fuel oil, if necessary) to obtain an overall heating value of 18.6 MJ/kg or greater (Davis et al, 2000). Blending is also used to limit the net chlorine content of c"}

This is commonly referred to as \u201cfour 9s DRE\u201d; higher DREs may be referred to as five 9s, six 9s, that is, 99.999 and 99.9999 percent DRE, respectively. Because of the complexity of the wastes being burned, little success has been achieved in predicting the time and temperature requirements for achieving the 99.99 percent DRE. Empirical tests ( trial burns) are required to demonstrate compli-\nance. Experience has demonstrated that highly halogenated materials are more diffi-cult to destroy than those with low halogen content.\nIncinerator Types.  Two technologies dominate the incineration field: liquid inj-\nection and rotary kiln incinerators. Over 90 percent of all incineration facilities use o"}
{"text": "ne of these technologies. Of these, more than 90 percent are liquid injection units. Less commonly used incinerators include fluidized beds and starved air/pyrolysis  systems. Horizontal, vertical, and tangential liquid injection units are used. The majority of the incinerators for hazardous wastes inject liquid hazardous waste at 350 to 700 kPa through an atomizing nozzle into the combustion chamber. These liquid incinerators vary in size from 300,000 to 90 million Joules of heat released per second. An auxil-iary fuel such as natural gas or fuel oil is often used when the waste is not autogenous. The liquid wastes are atomized into fine droplets as they are injected. A droplet size in the range 40 to 100 mm is obtained with atomizers or nozzles. The droplet volatilizes in the hot gas stream and the gas is oxidized. Efficient destruction of liquid hazardous wastes requires minimizing unevaporated droplets and unreacted vapors. Residence time, temperature, and turbulence (often referred to as the \u201cthree Ts\u201d) are optimized to increase destruction efficiencies. Typical residence times are 0.5 to 2 seconds. Incinerator temperatures usually range between 800 and 1,6008 C. A high \ndegree of turbulence is desirable for achieving effective destruction of the organic chemicals in the waste. Depending on whether the liquid incinerator flow is axial, radial, or tangential, additional fuel burners and separate waste injection nozzles can be arranged to achieve the desired temperature, t"}
{"text": "urbulence, and residence time. Vertical units are less likely to experience ash buildup. Tangential units have a much higher heat release and generally superior mixing. The rotary kiln is often used in hazardous waste disposal systems because of its versatility in processing solid, liquid, and containerized wastes. Waste is incinerated in a refractory-lined rotary kiln, as shown in Figure 12-11. The shell is mounted at a slight incline from the horizontal plane to facilitate mixing the waste materials with circulating air. Solid wastes and drummed wastes are usually fed by a conveyor system or a ram. Liquids and pumpable sludges are injected through a nozzle. Noncombustible metal and other residues are discharged as ash at the end of the kiln. Rotary kilns are typically 1.5 to 4 m in diameter and range in length from 3 to 10 m. Rotary kiln incinerators usually have a length-to-diameter ratio ( L/D) of between two \nand eight. Rotational speeds range from 0.5 to 2.5 cm/s, depending on kiln periphery. High L/D ratios, along with slower rotational speeds, are used for wastes requiring \nlonger residence times. The feed end of the kiln has airtight seals to adequately control \nthe initial incineration reactions.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 912  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 912  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesHAZARDOUS WA"}

Hydrochloric acid generated from chlorinated hydrocarbon wastes is \nneutralized by the lime in the kiln while slightly lowering the alkalinity of the cement products. While cement plants can save energy by incinerating liquid wastes, the ex-pense of obtaining permits and public resistance have inhibited use of this process.\nAir Pollution Control (APC).  Typical APC equipment on an incinerator will in-\nclude an afterburner, liquid scrubber, demister, and fine particulate control device. Af-terburners are used to control emission of unburned organic by-products by providing additional combustion volume at an elevated temperature. Scrubbers are used to phys-ically remove particulate matter, acid gases, and residual organics from the combus-tion gas stream. Metals, of course, are not destroyed in the incineration process. Some are volatilized and then collected in the air pollution control device. The large liqui"}
{"text": "d droplets that escape from the scrubber are captured in a mist collector. The final stage in gas cleaning is to remove the fine particles that remain.  Electrostatic precipitators have been used for this step. Scrubber water and residues from other APC devices are still considered hazardous and must be treated before ultimate land disposal.\nPermitting of Hazardous Waste Incinerators.   The permitting of hazardous waste \nincinerators is a complex, multifaceted program conducted simultaneously on federal, \nstate, and local levels. Because of the variety of state and local regulations for the  handling, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes, as well as those  concerning the operation of incinerators, each startup has a unique set of permit  requirements. Generally speaking, hazardous waste incinerators require at least the following per-mits: federal RCRA, state RCRA, for PCBs\u2014-the Toxic Substances and Control Act (TSCA), state and federal wastewater discharge, and state and federal air pollution control. A variety of local permits may also be necessary. Each of these require data substantiating an incinerator\u2019s operation at or above performance levels determined by environmental legislation. Each requires a public hearing and discussion of environmental impacts as well. Hazardous waste incinerators must meet three performance standards (Theodore and Reynolds, 1987):\n 1. Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHC). The DRE for a given \nPOHC is defined "}
{"text": "as the mass percentage of the POHC removed from the waste. The POHC performance standard requires that the DRE for each POHC desig-\nnated in the permit be 99.99 percent or higher. The DRE performance standard implicitly requires sampling and analysis to measure the amounts of the des-ignated POHC(s) in both the waste stream and the stack effluent gas during a trial burn. (The term designated POHC is described in more detail later in this section.) The DRE is determined for each designated POHC from a mass balance of the waste introduced into the incinerator and in the stack gas*:\n DRE 5(W\nin2Wout)\nWin3100%   (12-9)\n*Note that this is not a mass balance around the incinerator. Hazardous waste that ends up in the scrubber water, \nAPC residue, and ash are not counted. Hence, the oxidation can be very poor and the incinerator can still meet the 99.99 percent rule if the scrubber is efficient and/or the waste ends up in the ash. This is one reason that residues are considered hazardous and must be treated before land disposal.dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 914  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 914  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesHAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT   915\nwhere Win 5 mass feed rate of one POHC in the waste stream\n W out 5  mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust \nemissions prior to release to the atmosphe"}

An incinerator burning hazardous waste and producing \nstack emissions of more than 1.8 kg/h of hydrogen chloride (HCl) must con-\ntrol HCl emissions such that the rate of emission is no greater than the larger of either 1.8 kg/h or 1 percent of the HCl in the stack gas prior to entering any pollution control equipment.\n 3. Particulates. Stack emissions of particulate matter are limited to 180 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm) for the stack gas corrected to 7 percent oxygen. This adjustment is made by calculating a corrected concentration:\n P\nc5Pm 14\n212Y (12-10)\nwhere Pc 5 corrected concentration of particulate, mg/dscm\n P m 5 measured concentration of particulate, mg/dscm\n Y  5 percent oxygen in the dry flue gas\nIn this way, a decrease in the particulate concentration due solely to in-\ncreasing air flow in the stack is not rewarded, and an increase in the particu-late concentration due solely to reduction in the air flow in the stack is not penalized. Special rules for this calculation are being developed for oxygen-enriched combustion systems where the oxygen content is greater than the 21 percent found in the atmosphere.\n Compliance with these performance standards is documented by a trial burn of the facility\u2019s waste streams. As part of the RCRA permit application, a trial burn plan detailing waste analysis, an engineering description of the incinerator, sampling and monitoring procedures, test schedule and protocol, as well as co"}
{"text": "ntrol information, must be developed. If EPA determines that the design is adequate, a temporary or draft permit is issued. This allows the owner or operator to build the incinerator and initiate the trial burn procedure. The temporary permit covers four phases of operation. During the first phase, im-mediately following construction, the unit is operated for shake-down purposes to iden-tify possible mechanical deficiencies and to ensure its readiness for the trial burn procedures. This phase of the permit is limited to 720 h of operation using hazardous waste feed. The trial burn is conducted during the second phase. This is the most critical component of the permitting process, because it demonstrates the incinerator\u2019s ability to meet the three performance standards. In addition, performance data collected during the trial burn phase are reviewed by the permitting official and become the basis for set-ting the conditions of the facility permit. These conditions are: (1) allowable waste analysis procedures, (2) allowable waste feed composition (including acceptable varia-tions in the physical or chemical properties of the waste feed), (3) acceptable operating limits for carbon monoxide in the stack, (4) waste feed rate, (5) combustion tempera-ture, (6) combustion gas flow rate, and (7) allowable variations in incinerator design and operating procedures (including a requirement for shutoff of waste feed during startup, shutdown, and at any time when conditions of the permit a"}

The POHCs with the greatest potential for a low DRE, based on the ex-pected difficulty of thermal degradation (incinerability) and the concentration of the POHC in the waste, become the designated POHCs for the trial burn. The EPA permit review personnel work with the owners/operators of the incinerator facility in deter-mining which POHCs in a given waste should be designated for sampling and analysis during the trial burn. If a wide variety of wastes are to be treated, a difficult-to-incinerate POHC at high concentration may be proposed for the trial burn. The substitute POHC is referred to as a surrogate POHC. The surrogate POHC does not have to be actually present in the \nnormal waste. It does, however, have to be considered more difficult to incinerate than any POHC found in the waste. The third phase consists of completing the trial burn and submitting the results. This phase can last several weeks to several months, during which the incinerator is allowed to operate under specif"}
{"text": "ied conditions. The data to be reported to regulatory agencies after the burn are: (1) a quantitative analysis of the POHCs in the waste feed, (2) a determination of the concentration of the particulates, POHCs, oxygen, and HCl in the exhaust gas, (3) a quantitative analysis of any scrubber water, ash residues, and other residues to determine the fate of the POHCs, (4) a computation of the DRE for the POHCs, (5) a computation of the HCl removal efficiency if the\u00a0HCl emission rate exceeds 1.8 kg/h, (6) a computation of particulate emissions, (7) the identification of sources of fugitive emissions and their means of control, (8) a measurement of average, maximum, and minimum temperatures and combustion gas velocities (gas flows), (9) a continuous measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) in the exhaust gas, and (10) any other information EPA may require to determine compliance. Provided that performance standards are met in the trial burn, the facility can begin its fourth and final phase, which continues through the duration of the permit.

In the early to mid 1980s \u201cchemical fixation,\u201d \u201cencapsulation,\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d were often used interchangeably with solidification and stabilization. With the promulgation of the LDR restrictions, the EPA established a more precise definition for solidification/stabilization and discouraged the use of the other terms to describe the technology (U.S. EPA, 1988b). EPA linked solidification and stabilization because the resultant material from the treatment must be both stable and solid. \u201cStability\u201d is determined by the degree of resistance of the mixture of the hazardous waste and additive chem-ical to leaching in the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure  (TCLP) (55 FR \n26986, JUN 29, 1990). In the EPA definition, then, solidification/stabilization refers to chemical treatment processes that chemically reduce the mobility of the hazardous constituent. Reduced leachability is accomplished by the formation of a lattice structure and/or chemical bonds that bind the hazardous constituent and thereby limit the amount of constituent that can be leached when water or a mild acid solution comes into contact with the waste matrix. There are two principal solidification/stabilization processes: cement based and lime based. The cement or lime additive is mixed with the ash or sludge and water. It is then allowed to cure to form a solid. The correct mix proportions are determined by trial-and-error experiments on waste sample"}

In promulgating the final third of the LDR restrictions (55 FR 22530, 1\u00a0JUN 1990), the EPA allowed disposal of waste in Class I injection wells for wastes disposed under clean water act regulations.\nLand Treatment\nLand treatment is sometimes called \u201cland farming\u201d of the waste. In this practice, waste was incorporated with soil material in the manner that fertilizer or manure might be. Microorganisms in the soil degraded the organic fraction of the waste. Under the LDR restrictions, this practice is prohibited.\nThe Secure Landfill\nAlthough far from ideal, the use of land for the disposal of hazardous wastes is a major option for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we recognize that incinerator ash, scrubber bottoms, and the results of bi"}
{"text": "ological, chemical, and physical treatment leave residues of up to 20 percent of the original mass. These residues must be secured in an economical fashion. At this juncture, the secure landfill is the only option. The basic physical problem with land disposal of hazardous waste stems from the movement of water. The dissolution of waste material results in contaminants being trans-ported from the waste site to larger regions of the soil zone and, too often, to an underlying aquifer. Problems of groundwater pollution frequently lead to the condemnation of wells and to the contamination of surface water bodies fed by the associated aquifer. In many instances, well contamination is not detected until years after land disposal of waste has begun, because of the slow movement of the conveying ground  water (Wood et al., 1984). Water pollution, caused by a hazardous waste facility, may evolve in a variety of ways. Leachate from landfills may drain out of the side of the landfill and appear as surface runoff. It may seep down slowly through the unsaturated zone and enter an underlying aquifer. Fissures in liners lead to a downward migration of contaminants toward the water table. Without the institution of remedial measures, buried waste usually acts as a con-tinuing source of pollution. The waste constituents continue to be transported in the subsurface by infiltrating precipitation. Thus, sites that handle hazardous wastes are located above a natural barrier, as well as an applied"}
{"text": " liner. Moreover, the site is instru-mented to continuously monitor the condition of any associated aquifers. In addition, a system for the collection and treatment of the leachate is required. The technology of the secure landfill may be divided into two phases: siting and construction. The following discussion on siting is drawn primarily from E. F. Wood et al. (1984).\nLandfill Siting. In siting a hazardous waste landfill, the four main considerations are \nair quality, groundwater quality, surface water quality, and subsurface migration of dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 920  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 920  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesHAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT   921\ngases and leachates. Aside from the sociopolitical aspects, the last three components \nare the major factors to be considered in siting the landfill. Air quality must be considered to prevent adverse effects to the air caused by volatilization, gas generation, gas migration, and wind dispersal of landfilled hazard-ous wastes. Generally, these can be controlled by proper construction techniques and do not inhibit the siting. The hydrogeologic siting problem can be divided into four main areas: geology, soil, hydrology, and climate. Bedrock geology determines the structural framework that surfaces as landforms and the structural integrity of the land"}
{"text": "fill site. Structural integrity of host rock is important in terms of seismic risk zones, dip-ping, and cleavage. Seismic risk zones indicate the presence of geologic faults and fractures. Faults and fractures provide a natural pathway for the flow of contaminants, even in low-permeability and low-porosity rock. Transport capacity refers to a soil\u2019s ability to allow migration of contaminants. A soil with low permeability and porosity can lengthen the flow period and act as a natu-ral defense by retarding the movement of contaminants. Glacial outwash plains and deltaic sands are both well-sorted sand and gravel beds with high permeability. Thus, they allow wastes to move faster and farther. Clays and silts have lower permeabilities and, thus, inhibit the movement of wastes. Most contaminants will move either at the same rate or slower than the water. The relative speeds of the water and contaminant are a function of the contaminant and water characteristics. For example, organic contaminants that are relatively insoluble in water will be retarded more by the soil than organic contaminants that are relatively soluble in water. The pH of the water will also affect retardation. For example, at low pH (and in the absence of oxygen), iron will be present predominantly as ferrous iron (Fe\n21). This \niron is quite soluble and will move with the water. If the pH is high ( .6) and oxygen is \npresent, the iron will be in the ferric (Fe31) form, which is much less soluble in water. \nThe "}

Sorption includes both absorption and adsorption of contaminants. Sorption is \nimportant in limiting the movement of metals, phosphorus, and organic chemicals. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is a measure of the ability of the soil to trade cations in the soil for those in waste. The higher the CEC, the more metal will be retained. The capacity of soil to retard contaminant migration also depends on the presence of nu-merous hydrous oxides, particularly iron oxides, and other compounds such as phos-phates and carbonates. These compounds precipitate heavy metals out of solution, making them unable to travel farther. The hydrogen-ion concentration (pH) of soil influences the dominant removal mechanism for metal cations. The dominant removal mechanism for metal cations when pH , 5 is exchange or adsorption; when pH . 6, it is precipitation. Hydrologic considerations in locating a hazardous waste landfill include distance to the groundwater table, the hydraulic gradient, the proximity of wells, and the prox-imity to surface waters. When distance from the surface to the groundwater table is short"}
{"text": ", contaminant travel time is also short, allowing for little attenuation before pollutants disperse later-ally in the saturated zone. It is desirable to have the average distance to the groundwa-ter table large enough so that contaminants may be significantly attenuated. This also facilitates monitoring of the saturated zone. This will permit remedial action to be undertaken, if necessary. A hydraulic gradient that slopes away from local groundwater supplies is de-sired. The steeper the hydraulic gradient, the lower the attenuation time and the faster the water movement. Therefore, a moderate hydraulic gradient may be most acceptable. The distance from the disposal site to water-supply wells and surface waters must be as large as possible to protect them from potential contamination in case the landfill leaks. Furthermore, the proximity to surface waters must take into account the poten-tial for flooding. Site flooding will weaken the structure of a land emplacement facil-ity, causing it to fail and leak wastes. Therefore, it is essential that the facility not be built on a floodplain or area subject to local flooding. The facility should be designed so that it will not be flooded. Climate is considered a driving force in contaminant migration, but we may  exclude it when considering potential sites within the same region, where climate is unlikely to vary significantly.\nLandfill Construction.

The following paragraphs describe general consider-ations. All conditions may not exist at every site. Leaking chemicals pass through several different hydrologic zones as they migrate through the soil to the groundwater system. The pore spaces in the unsaturated zone in the top soil layers are occupied by both air and water. Flow in this zone for liquid con-taminants is downward by gravity. The upper region of the unsaturated zone is important for pollutant attenuation. Some chemicals are retained by adsorption onto organic mate-rial and chemically active soil particles. Some are trapped in the pore spaces and held by surface tension. These adsorbed and trapped chemicals may decompose through abiotic processes such as oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis, as well as microbial activity, or they may simply remain sorbed onto the particles.

The pore spaces between soil particles below the water table are saturated. Gener-ally, the saturated zone is devoid of oxygen. The lack of dissolved oxygen limits the oxidation of chemicals. Groundwater flow is laminar, with minimal mixing occurring as the groundwater moves. Dissolved chemicals will flow with groundwater and form distinct plumes. The shape and size of a contaminant plume depends upon the local hydrogeological set-ting, groundwater flow, the characteristics of the contaminants, and geochemistry.

A preliminary assessment (PA) is the first step in identifying the potential for con-\ntamination from a particular site. The primary objectives of the PA are to determine if there has been a release of contaminant to the environment, if there is immediate danger to persons living or working near the site, and whether a site inspection is necessary. Samples for environmental analysis are generally not taken during the PA. Following the preliminary assessment, EPA or the designated state agency might determine that an immediate threat to residents or employees at the site requires an immediate removal action. Otherwise, on the basis of the preliminary assessment, the site is classified by EPA into one of the three following categories:\n 1. There is no further action needed, because there is no threat to human health \nor the environment.\n 2. Additional information is required to complete the preliminary assessment.\n 3. Inspection of the site is necessary.\nSite Inspection.  Site inspection requires sampling to determine the types of hazardous \nsubstances that are present and to identify the extent of contamination and its migration. The actual site inspection includes preparation of a work plan and an on-site safety plan. The site assessment has three objectives:\n 1. To determine which releases pose no threat t"}

Problem definition questions: What are the contaminants and how much con-\ntamination is present? How large is the surface area of the contaminated site? \nWhat is the size of the contaminated groundwater plume? Where is the exact location of the plume and in what direction is it moving?\n 2. Design questions: Based on the alternatives available, what is the best way to \nclean up the site? How should these alternatives be implemented? What prod-ucts will be produced during treatment? How long will it take to complete the remediation and what will it cost?\n 3. Policy questions: What level of protection is adequate? In other words, how \nclean is clean?\nThe answers to the first two sets of questions require scientific and engineering back-ground that is supported by extensive sampling of the contaminated site area. The last question cannot be answered objectively; rather, it is a subjective and oftentimes political question. The NCP defines three types of responses for incidents involving hazardous sub-stances. In these responses removal is differentiated from remediation. Removal is, as \nits name suggests, the physical relocation of the waste\u2014usually to a secure hazardous waste landfill.

These emergencies might include fires; explosions; direct human contact with a hazardous substance; human, animal, or food-chain exposure; or contamination of drinking water sources. An immediate removal involves cleaning up the hazardous site to protect human health and life, containing the hazardous release, and minimizing the potential for damage to the environment. For example, a truck, train, or barge spill could involve an immediate removal determination by EPA to get the spill cleaned up. Immediate removal responses may include activities such as sa"}
{"text": "mple collection and analysis, containment or control of the release, removal of the hazardous sub-stances from the site, provision of alternate water supplies, installation of security fences, evacuation of threatened citizens, or general deterrent of the spread of the haz-ardous contaminants. A planned removal involves a hazardous site that does not present an immediate emergency. Under Superfund, EPA may initiate a planned removal if the action will minimize the damage or risk and is consistent with a more effective long-term solution to the problem. Planned removals are carried out by EPA if the responsible party is either unknown or cannot or will not take timely and appropriate action. The state in which the cleanup is located must be willing to match at least 10 percent of the costs of the removal action, as well as agree to nominate the site in question for the National Priority List.\nMitigation and Treatment\nBecause the spread of contaminants is usually confined to a plume, only localized areas of an aquifer need to be reclaimed and restored. Cleanup of a contaminated aquifer, however, is often time-consuming and costly. The original source of contamination can be eliminated, but the complete restoration of the groundwater is fraught with addi-tional problems, such as defining the site\u2019s subsurface soil and geologic composition, locating contamination sources, defining contaminant transport pathways, determining the extent and concentration of the contaminants, and ch"}

Examples of remedial methods include (LaGrega et al., 2001):\n \u2022 Installing pumping wells to remove the contaminated water and then treating it \nwith one of the technologies described in Section 12-6 (called pump and treat)\n \u2022 Air sparging\n \u2022 Soil vapor extraction \u2022 Reactive treatment walls (also known as permeable reactive barriers ) that allow \nthe contaminated plume to pass through a reactive chemical or a an acclimated \nbiomass.\nIn the next few paragraphs we will discuss the first of these systems.

The objectives of a pump-and-treat system include hydraulic con-\ntainment of the contaminated plume and removal of the contaminant from the ground-water. The design of the well system for a pump-and-treat remediation is an application of well hydraulics described in Chapter 4. The capture zone of an extraction well is that portion of the groundwater that \nwill discharge into the well. The capture zone is not necessarily coincident with the cone of depression (Chapter 4) because the groundwater flow lines can be diverted by the influence of the pumping well without being captured by the well (Figure 12-15).

The extent of the capture \nzone depends on the regional hydraulic gradient as well as the transmissivity and pumping rate. Three parameters are used to delineate the capture zone: (1) the width of the cap-ture zone at an infinite distance up-gradient from the pumping well, "}
{"text": "(2) the width of the capture zone at the location of the pumping well, and (3) the location of the down- gradient distance of the capture zone from the pumping well (called the stagnation point). These parameters are shown in Figure 12-16. Javandel and Tsang (1986) developed a highly idealized model of the capture zone that can be used to examine the relationship between some of the important variables. The model assumes a homogeneous, isotropic aquifer uniform in cross section and infinite in width. The aquifer may be either confined or unconfined. However, in the case of the unconfined aquifer, drawdown must be insignificant with respect to the total thickness of the aquifer. The extraction wells are assumed to be fully penetrating. With a single well located at the origin of the coordinate system shown in Figure 12-16, Javandel and Tsang (1986) developed the following equation to describe the y coordinate of the capture zone envelope:\n y56\nQ\n2Dv2Q\n2pDv tan21\n y\nx (12-15)\nwhere x, y 5 distances from the origin m\n Q  5 well pumping rate, m3/s\n D  5 aquifer thickness, m\n v  5 Darcy velocity, m/sFIGURE 12-16\nType curve for analytical solution to capture zone analysis for a single extraction well. \n(Source: Javandel and Tsang, 1986.)Regional flowWidth of capture zone, m\nPumping wellStagnation point\n400\nxy\n800120016001000\n500\nxsp\n\u2013500\n\u2013500 500 1000\nLength of plume, m1500 2000 2500 00\n\u20131000= 2000 m MaximumQ\nDvdav01145_ch12_866-954.indd Page 932  10/25/11  1:31 PM user-f462dav0114"}

This can be calculated using the methods discussed in Chapter 4. For an unconfined aquifer, the restriction noted above, that the drawdown must be insig-nificant with respect to the total thickness of the aquifer, requires a judgment decision.\nExample 12-8.

{"text": "movement of a contami-nant plume, in actual field sites the boundary conditions are rarely met. Computer models that have been calibrated to the local conditions will yield more reliable, although not perfect, understanding of the behavior of a proposed pump-and-treat system. Because the rate of removal of contaminant decreases exponentially over time, and because the concentrations in the water rebound over time because of diffusion and desorption from the soil, pump-and-treat systems are limited in their value as a mass removal technology. Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs) such as gasoline are referred to as \u201cproduct\u201d because their recovery may have some commercial value. When the NAPL floats on the groundwater table, special recovery techniques may be employed to recover it. Product recovery systems to recover NAPL use wells that terminate in the NAPL plume rather than in the aquifer. Because all hydrocarbons are slightly soluble in water, the product recovery system is usually accompanied by a groundwater pumping system to remove and treat the contaminated groundwater.

Beyond this simple definition, there are as many definitions as there are authors that write on the subject. This results from the many perspectives the authors bring to the subject. Here are several perspectives from which one might view sustainability: developing coun-tries, developed countries, ecological, economic, social justice, worldwide, regional, national"}
{"text": ", local. The conventional starting point for discussions on sustainability is that published by the World Commission on Environment and Development* (WCED, 1987): Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. For our starting point, we prefer to define sustainability in terms of a sustainable economy. A sustainable economy  \nis one that produces wealth and provides jobs for many human generations without degrading the environment. There are two fundamental principles of this definition of sustainability:\n \u2022 Reduction in the use of both renewable and nonrenewable natural resources.\n \u2022 Provision of solutions that are both long-term and market-based.\n In the first instance, emphasis is placed on reduction of natural resources rather \nthan end-of-pipe solutions. In a sustainable economy, development focuses on mini-mizing resource consumption through increased efficiency, reuse and recycling, and substitution of renewable resources for nonrenewable resources.  Renewable resources  \nare those that can be replaced within a few human generations. Some examples are timber, surface water, and alternative sources of power such as solar and wind. Non-renewable resources are those that are replaceable only in geologic time scales. Groundwater, fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) and metal ores are examples of nonrenewable resources. In the second instance, an effective and c"}
{"text": "ost-efficient approach is for society to provide incentives to use alternatives or reduce the use of water, coal, gasoline, and other substances. Some of these incentives are in the form of technological advances that improve efficiency and some are in the form of sociopolitical changes.\nThe People Problem\nAn inherent problem with definitions of sustainability is \u201cThe People Problem,\u201d that is, the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  To understand the \n\u201cThe People Problem\u201d we need to understand the characteristics of population growth.\n*It is also known as the Brundtland Commission Report, after its chairman.dav01145_ch13_955-1010.indd Page 956  11/3/11  12:15 PM user-f462dav01145_ch13_955-1010.indd Page 956  11/3/11  12:15 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles A simple way of viewing population growth is by assuming that growth is exponential:\n Pt5Po ekt  (13-1)\nwhere P t 5 population at time t\n Po 5 population at time t 5 0\n k 5 rate of growth, individuals/individual ? year\n t 5 time\nThe growth rate is a function of the crude birth rate (b), crude death rate (d ), immigra-\ntion rate (i), and emigration rate (e): \nk5b2d1i2e (13-2)\nExample 13-1 provides an illustration of a crude estimate of population growth.\nExample 13-1.

For example, China\u2019s rate of growth in 1964 was about 31 per 1,000 people per year. In 1990, it was about 12 per 1,000 people per year. In 2010, it was about 5 per 1,000 people per year. As reference points, China\u2019s per capita income in 2000 was $950. Current (2010) growth projections estimate per capita income at $6,000 by 2015. For comparison, the rate of growth in the United States was about 6 per 1,000 people in 2010; in the United Kingdom and France it was 4 per 1,000 people in 2010.\n Projections of population using Equation 13-1 are quite crude. More sophisticated \nanalyses take into account the total fertility rate  (TFR). The TFR is the average number \nof children that would be born alive to a woman, assuming that current age-specific birth rates remain constant through the women\u2019s reproductive years.

Recent studies (Bremner et al. , 2010) reveal that the world\u2019s population has \nreached a transition point. The rapid growth of the second half of the 20th century has slowed. However, factors such as improving mortality and slower than expected de-clines in birth rate guarantee continued growth. Current projections of world popula-tion in 2050 range from 9.15 billion to 9.51 billion (Bremner, et al ., 2010). This places \nthe population growth on the \u201cmoderate fertility reduction\u201d curve in Figure 13-1. This is a 38 percent global population increase rather than the 62 percent increase calcu-lated in Example 13-1. Given limited resources, both nonrenewable and renewable, there are long-term (. 100 years) implications for population growth that cannot be resolved by techno-\nlogical solutions (for example, food for starving people). We make this statement to place the remainder of the discussion in this chapter in context. We will focus on cur-rently available technological improvements.\nThere Are No Living Dinosaurs\nOver the millennia, the climate of the earth has changed.

As noted in that chapter, the impacts of global warming on North America are forecast to be a mix of \u201cgood news\u201d and \u201cbad news.\u201d Exactly how these impacts will be addressed is a formidable challenge. Vulnerability is a term used to assess the impacts of climate change in general and global warming in particular. To be vulnerable to the effects of global warming, human-environmental systems must not only be exposed to and sensitive to the changes but also unable to cope with the changes (Polsky and Cash, 2005). Conversely, human-environmental systems are relatively sustainable if they possess strong adaptive capacity and can employ it effectively. In the United States we have abundant crop-land, sufficient natural resources, and a robust economy that gives us a strong adaptive capacity and, hence, a capacity for a relatively sustainable human-environmental system. Whether or not we can employ it effectively is another question. Many other countries do not have these key ingredients and, therefore, do not have a strong adaptiv e capacity . . . they are vulnerable.\n We use the term relatively sustainable  because there are limits to growth using \n20th century economic models based on exploitation of nonrenewable resources. The time frame for adaptation on a global basis is on the order of a few generations or less for energy and minerals at current growth rates in consumption. Certain countri"}

These programs place considerable emphasis on the selection of green materials or products as an important aspect of sustainability. In addition to these new assessment systems, an old system called life cycle as-sessment (LCA) has taken on a new perspective. Traditionally, LCA focused on the costs of building, operating, and closing a facility as a method of comparison of alter-natives. The new LCA approach is a methodology for assessing the environmental performance of a product over its full life cycle (Trusty, 2009).

In Chapter 4, we discussed floods from the perspective of hydrologists and civil engineering applica-tions. Here we will use these tools to discuss floods from the perspective of sustain-ability. While the discussion of droughts was not explicitly addressed in Chapter 4, the hydrologic equations for water balance and risk estimation discussed there also apply to droughts. We will use these in discussing droughts in the context of sustainability. A large portion of this text is devoted to environmental engineering measures to prevent water from becoming \u201ctoo dirty\u201d and cleaning water that is \u201ctoo dirty.\u201d\nFloods\nThere are two broad categories of floods: coastal and inland. Inland floods, also called inundation floods, as the name implies are the result of a combination of meteorological events that result in inundation of a floodplain. These may be seasonal, such as the his-toric flooding of the Nile and the rhythmic monsoons that flood great portions of India, or they may be highly irregular with long return periods. Coastal flooding most fre-quently results from "}

Earthquakes are a major \ncause of tsunamis. They most frequently occur along the Pacific rim because of crustal instability. Wave heights range from barely noticeable to over 10 m with run-ups from less than 5 m to over 500 m. Floods by themselves are not disasters. Floods occurred long before civilizations arose and will continue long after they have disappeared. Inland floods bring nutrients and contribute to alterations in the river channel that provide nursery habitat for young fish, destroy existing riparian communities, and create new environments for new eco-systems. Both field data and model studies indicate that the most complex and diverse ecosystems are maintained only in riparian environments that fluctuate because of flooding (Power et al., 1995). Estuaries and natural coastal areas are characterized by many different habitats, ranging "}
{"text": "from sandy beaches to salt marshes, mud flats, and tidal pools, that are inhabited by an extraordinary variety of animals and plants. In a similar fashion to inland floods, coastal floods alter the landscape to create new environments for new ecosystems. Around 3000 B.C.E., the world\u2019s first agriculturally based urban civilizations ap-peared in Egypt and Mesopotamia and maize farming began in Central America. As populations grew, people moved to the floodplains to tap the natural resources of water and fish. Over the millennia these urban civilizations matured and grew such that today half of the world\u2019s 6.9 billion people live in an urban environment. There are between 18 and 25 major metropolitan cities with a population over 10 million (often cited as megacities). Most of these are located near water bodies that, at some point in time, will bring catastrophic floods. Although only about 7 percent of the United States\u2019 total land area lies in flood-plains, more than 20,800 communities are located in flood-prone areas (Hays, 1981). By the mid-1990s, 12 percent of the population occupied more than seven million structures in areas of periodic inundation (Gruntfest, 2000). About 50 percent of the population lives near the coast (Smith and Ward, 1998). For every city like Chicago or Detroit that are relatively isolated from inland or costal flooding, there are cities like St. Louis, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York that will probably experience a major flood before"}

From 1972 to 1979, 1,900 \ncommunities were declared disaster areas by the federal government more than once, 351 were inundated at least three times, 46 at least four times, and 4 at least five times. Between 1900 and 1980 the coast of Florida experienced 50 major hurricanes, and even as far north as Maryland there is an average of one hurricane per year that has direct or fringe effects on the coast (Smith and Ward, 1998).\nFloods and Climate Change. The amount of precipitation falling in the heaviest \n1\u00a0percent of the rain events in the United States increased 20 percent in the past 50\u00a0years with eastern events increasing by greater than 60 percent and western"}
{"text": " events increasing by 9 percent (Karl et al., 2009). During this time period, the greatest in-creases in heavy precipitation have occurred in the Northeast and Midwest. Using the middle 50 percent of the values from Global Circulation Models (GCMs), annual precipitation forecasts have been made for the time period 2080\u20132099. They are sum-marized as follows:\n \u2022 western United States: 0 to 9 percent increase,\n \u2022 central United States: precipitation projections cannot be distinguished from \nnatural variability,\n \u2022 eastern United States: increase by 5 to 10 percent.\nThese data (Figure 13-2) and projections imply that higher intensity rainfall is to be \nexpected. With higher intensities comes high river flow rates and the potential for more floods. As a result of melting of glaciers, global warming models predict an increase in sea level between 0.2 and 0.6 m by 2100 (IPCC, 2007). The sources of sea level rise include thermal expansion, melting of glaciers and ice caps, melting of the Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet. This will result in the loss of about 30 percent of global coast wetlands and an increase in coastal flooding.\nFloods and Sustainability.  Vulnerability, in terms of flood planning, is a measure of \nthe ability to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from harm caused by a flood \nhazard (Blaikie et al., 1994). As we noted in Section 13-1, human-environmental sys-tems are relatively sustainable if they possess strong adaptive capacity and can emplo"}
{"text": "y it effectively. The Mississippi River floods regularly (notably so in 1927, 1937, 1947, 1965, 1993, 2008, and 2010). Florida has had hurricane flood surges in the range of 2 to 5 meters on at least five occasions (1935, 1960, 1992, and twice in 2004). The fact that the environs of the Mississippi River and Florida remain inhabited and prospering is evidence of sustainability and the adaptability of the people. As shown in Tables 13-1 and 13-2, this has not been without cost. For a country like Bangladesh, the question of sustainability is moot. Because Bangladesh is a country of rivers, 66 percent of the country\u2019s 144,000 km\n2 is either a \nfloodplain or a delta. About 75 percent of the runoff from the Himalayan mountains drains through the country from July to October. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,500 mm in the west to over 3,000 mm in the southeast.

The surge effects are accentuated by a large astronomical tide, the sea-bed bathymetry, with shallow water extending to more than 300 km offshore in the northern part of the bay, and the coastal configuration that accentuates the funnel shape of the bay by a right-angle change in the coastline. This produces maximum storm-surge levels that are higher than would be produced on a straight coastline (Smith and Ward, 1998).

They need outside help. Using funds from the National Science Foundation and the Georgia Tech Foundation to supplement sporadic funding from USAID (whose priorities changed from the Clinton to the Bush administration), Webster et al. (2010) were able to develop an exploratory project of 10-day flood forecasts to provide advance warning and allow implementation of an emergency response plan. The forecasts and response were successful for the 2009 flood season. The savings resulting from the forecast was estimated to be US$130\u2013190 for fishery and agriculture income, US$500 per ani-mal, and US$270 per household. Given that the average farmer\u2019s income is approxi-mately US$470, the savings in the flooded regions were substantial. To continue this success, a better funding base and increased collaboration between federal and inter-national agencies is required.\nFloods and Green Engineering.

Technological advances have made warning systems \navailable to more than 1,000 communities in the United States. Coupled with ad-\nvances in meteorological forecasting, these systems are lifesavers. The reduction in flood and hurricane fatalities can, in"}
{"text": " part, be directly related to implementation of these systems (see for example Tables 13-1 and 13-2). The lack of a warning system, as for example in Bangladesh, inevitably leads to great loss of life (Table 13-3). However, without a plan for disseminating the warning message and imple-menting an evacuation plan, the warning system is useless. The 1,835 fatalities in New Orleans that resulted from the Katrina hurricane in 2005 may be attributed to the lack of provision for the poor and handicapped that had no transportation be-fore, during, and after the event as well as remote, safe facilities to accommodate them. Given the difficulty in evacuating New Orleans, a metropolitan area with a popu-lation of 1,235,650 people, the prospects for successful evacuation of even a portion of one of the world\u2019s megacities in the event of a forecast 100- or 500-year storm or flood appear slim. Of course, a warning system is only necessary after poor land use decisions have been made. The fact that the material resources and habitat are destroyed in a flood diminishes the potential for a sustainable economy that produces wealth and provides jobs.\nAcquisition and Relocation. One of the most successful, sustainable, long-term so-\nlutions to repeated flooding is to move people and structures out of the floodplain. Almost 40 years ago the U.S. federal government authorized a cost-sharing program for relocation. One of the most dramatic uses of these funds was for the relocation of the village "}
{"text": "of Valmeyer, Illinois, from the Mississippi floodplain to a bluff 120 m above the river and two miles away. The village had been flooded in 1910, 1943, 1944, and 1947. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers raised the levee to 14\u00a0m after the 1947 flood, it was topped by the 1993 flood, which destroyed 90 percent of the buildings. Relocation and rebuilding began almost immediately. The first business opened in May 1994 and the first home was occupied in April 1995. The town\u2019s population at the time of the 1993 flood was 900. In 2009, the population was 1,168. Other examples of buyouts and relocation include Hopkinsville, Kentucky; Bismarck, North Dakota; Montgomery, Alabama; and Birmingham, Alabama. Since the 1993 Mississippi flood, nearly 20,000 properties in 36 states have been bought out (Gruntfest, 2000). From a practical point of view, it is unlikely that more than a few of the 20,800 U.S communities that are flooded regularly are able or willing to move. However, it is fre-quently the case that only a portion of the town is flooded. This opens the opportunity for sections of communities to be relocated. The floodway can then become a resource for replenishment of the river ecosystem. In the last few decades, this type of activity has been a means of revitalization of downtown business districts. Predisaster miti-gation by acquisition and relocation has resulted in benefit-cost ratios between 1.67 dav01145_ch13_955-1010.indd Page 966  11/3/11  12:15 PM user-f462dav0114"}

Given the immense cost of floods (Tables 13-1 and 13-2), this \nseems like an excellent market-based approach.\nDroughts\nDrought means something different for a climatologist, an agriculturalist, a hydrologist, a public water supply management official, and a wildlife biologist. There are more than 150 published definitions of drought. The literature of the 21st century appears to have adopted the classification by Wilhite and Glantz (1985). They address these different perspectives by classifying drought as a sequence of definitions related to the drought process and disciplinary perspectives: meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomical/political drought. Bruins (2000) adds another useful subdivision: pastoral drought. In summary the definitions are as follows:\n \u2022 Meteorological (climatological) drought : a deficiency of precipitation for an \nextended period of time that results from persistent large scale disruptions in the \ndynamic processes of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n \u2022 Agricultural drought: a dry period where arable land that can be cultivated does not receive enough precipitation. This may occur even if the total annual pre-cipitation reaches the average amount or above because the precipitation d"}
{"text": "oes not occur when the crop needs it. An example is in an early growth stage when seeds are germinating.\n \u2022 Pastoral drought: land that is nonarable but is suitable for grazing may not re-\nceive enough moisture to keep natural, indigenous vegetation alive.\n \u2022 Hydrological drought: this type is reflected in reduced stream flow, reservoir drawdown, dry lake beds, and lowering of the piezometric surface in wells.\n \u2022 Socioeconomical/political drought : this type of drought occurs when the govern-\nment or the private sector creates a demand for more water than is normally available. This may result from attempts to convert nonarable pasture to cultiva-tion or population growth that outstrips the water supply.\nThe relationship between these various types of droughts, the duration of drought events, and the resultant socioeconomic impacts is shown schematically in Figure 13-3. The temporal sequence in drought recovery begins when precipitation returns to normal and meteorological drought conditions have abated.

The annual inundations brought moisture and nutrients to the soil. Low floods meant hardship because there was insufficient soil moisture and nutrients for crops. Hydrological drought in the Nile River has been documented for the period from 3000 B.C.E. to modern times. For the early Dynastic period and the Old Kingdom (circa 3000\u20132125 B.C.E.) there are 63 annual flood records from 11 different rulers. During this period there was a decrease of the mean discharge of about 30 percent (Bell, 1970; Butzer, 1976). It has been posited* that between 2250 and perhaps 1950 B.C.E. there was a series of catastrophic low floods (i.e., droughts) that lead to the demise of the Old Kingdom and the start of the First Intermediate period (Bell, 1971; Butzer, 1976).

Between 622 and \n999 C.E. there were 102 years of poor floods (Bell, 1975). Typically, we in the United States often associate drought with arid, semiarid, subhumid regions.

Looking back, we have a better understanding of \nboth the beginning and the end. One method of evaluation of a historic drought is the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The PDSI is a single number representing precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture, recharge, and runoff (Palmer, 1965). These measurements are discussed in Chapter 4. Implicitly, they are a measure of \u201cagricultural drought.\u201d Numerous authors have criticized the PDSI for a wide variety of reasons. Funda-mentally, it is not an operational tool because the drought must end before it can be calculated. Moreover, it requires a substantial amount of sophisticated measurements and calculations to develop the index number. Nonetheless, it has has been used exten-sively to evaluate droughts in the United States. Even here it has limitations because Palmer used data from Iowa and Kansas that are not representative of the western states where snow accumulation and snow melt are an important component of the water balance.

However, the 1930s drought was by far the worst drought over the last 500 years based on regional coverage, intensity, and duration. The 11-year drought from 1946 through 1956 was the second worst drought to impact the United States during the 20th century.

Of special note is that these droughts lasted between 6 and 14 \nyears and that shorter drought periods were not considered in the research. Earlier work using dendrochronology identified longer drought periods of severe drought (PDSI ,23.00) circa 900\u20131100 C.E. (200 years) and 1200\u20131350 C.E.

Shorter drought periods, particularly in the southwest, have much shorter return periods.

California has the most precarious water resource system in the United States. The vast majority of the population is concentrated in the semi-arid southern part of the state. Seventy percent of the water supplies are in the north and 80 percent of the de-mand is in the midsection and the south. California droughts of two or more years have occurred eight times in the last century. Record-breaking droughts occurred in the hy-drologic years 1928\u20131934, 1976\u20131977, and 1987\u20131992. The most recent drought lasted from the hydrologic year 2007 to well into the 2010 hydrologic year.

The trend in annual flow volume measured at Lee\u2019s Ferry from 1895 through 2003 shows a continuous decline of about 0.5 million acre-feet per decade. This is due, in part, to upstream water use. Dendrocological analysis of Utah trees has revealed four droughts lasting more than 20 years, and nine lasting 15 to 20 years (USGS, 2004). Similar data from Mesa V erde, Arizona, reveal a drought lasting 23 years from circa 1276 to 1299 C.E. \n(Haury, 1935). Flow data from Lee\u2019s Ferry show three droughts lasting from four to eleven years and an ongoing drought from 2000 through 2003 (USGS, 2004). Until the late 1970s, Arizona depended almost exclusively on groundwater to supply municipal water needs. The sparse precipitation means that the aquifer received virtually no recharge. As a consequence, the aquifer was literally being mined.\nThe Rio Grande.

Theoretically, safe yield defines the capability of a water source to sustain \na stipulated level of water supply over time as river inflows and groundwater recharge varies both seasonally and annually (Dziegielewski and Crews, 1986). The engineering application of this definition is presented in Chapter 4. There are two major assumptions in the procedures described in Chapter 4: (1) the data exhibit stationarity, and (2) the required level of water supply remains constant. Stationarity means that the data do not exhibit trend or periodicity, or that any trend in the data is explicable and capable of reliable extrapolation into the future (Smith and Ward, 1998). The decline in flow of the Colorado River noted under \u201cRegional Water Resource Limitations\u201d and the forecast of reduction in snow melt runoff for California are just two examples of the lack of station-arity in the data. Population growth and increased saltwater intrusion because of rising sea levels are examples of the change in the required level of water supply that invali-dates the second assumption. Nonetheless, the comparison of safe yield estimates and \u201ccurrent\u201d water consumption shown in Table 13-7 provide an example of a convenient way to benchmark a municipal water supply. From the perspective of drought mitigation, any water supply system with aver-age demands below the safe yield should not experience water shortages during droughts that are less severe th"}

Beginning at the end of the 19th century and continuing to \nthis day, numerous audacious water projects have been developed to keep people com-ing to the state. Early in the 1900s, after shallow aquifers and seasonal rivers could no longer sustain Los Angeles, land was purchased in the Owens Valley, east of the Sierra Nevada. Completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct sent the entire flow of the Owens River to Los Angeles. Within a decade the lake was a dust bowl and the San Fernado Valley was worth millions (Bourne and Burtynsky, 2010). In the intervening years, California has built over 2,000 miles (3,218 km) of canals, pipelines, and aqueducts to transport water from the north to the south. Because of"}
{"text": " its dependence on snowmelt for much of its water, over 157 reservoirs have been built \nto hold the melt water for later distribution. Major pumping stations, located in the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta, move the water to the south (Bourne and Burtynsky, 2010). The movement of water accounts for nearly 40 percent of the state\u2019s total energy supply (Feldman, 2007). The Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin Delta, a former 700,000 acre (283,300 ha) marsh, was drained and diked into islands that became prime farmland and exclusive residen-tial property surrounded by waterways. Today the delta sits 20 feet (6 m) below sea level. Sea level rise combined with more severe storms threaten the dikes. The delta sits just east of the Hayward Fault in one of the most dangerous earth-quake zones in the United States. The forecast is that there is greater than a 60 percent chance of a major earthquake in the next 30 years. The average island in the delta now has a 90 percent chance of flooding in the next 50 years (Bourne and Burtynsky, 2010). Los Angeles County has been pumping \u201cfresh\u201d water into the groundwater aquifer to prevent salt water intrusion into water supplies since 1947. About 10 billion gallons per year of recycled wastewater are used. The population of southern California is increasing at a rate of more than 200,000 per year. In 2010, California had a budget deficit of $20 billion and a proposal for $11 billion in water projects. Notwithstanding the implications of global warming, which ex"}

As with floods, civil engineering structures play \na minor role in sustainable drought protection. The \u201cgreen engineering\u201d component is \nrecognizing that traditional structural solutions are bound to fail and that other solutions are required to minimize risk and to provide a sustainable economy for many human \ngenerations. These solutions fall into two broad categories: drought response planning and water conservation planning and implementation.\nDrought Response Planning. The basic goal of a response plan is to improve re-\nsponse efforts by enhancing monitoring and early warning, impact assessment, pre-paredness, and response. Activities in these areas are summarized in the following paragraphs.dav01145_ch13_955-1010.indd Page 979  11/3/11  12:15 PM user-f462dav01145_ch13_955-1010.indd Page 979  11/3/11  12:15 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles980  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n \u2022 Early warning: Parameters that must be monitored to detect"}

The PDSI may be appropriate to evaluate past droughts but it has been criticized for its inability to make \u201creal time\u201d assessments. Other tools such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI), \nand the U.S. Drought Monitor (DM) maps have been proposed. Of these, the DM maps (http://www.drought.unl.edu/dm) are the most recent evolution. They are compiled with input from the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC), and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).\n \u2022 Preparedness: Plans and facilities to implement them generally require legisla-tive action. Examples include authorization to establish and activate water banks, mandatory conservation, drought surcharges, restrictions on outdoor residential use, and local emergency supply for municipalities and farm animals.\n \u2022 Response: People and animals cannot drink plans. Fish cannot swim in plans. Agencies and individuals must be given training and facilities to implement the plans.\nIn the United States, drought response planning is primarily a state respo"}
{"text": "nsibility. At this date (2010) only five states (Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Vermont) are without a drought response plan. California has delegated drought response planning to municipalities. San Diego has a vigorous, rigorous drought response plan that includes drought stages and re-quired responses that are enforceable by code. Violators are subject to fines and poten-tial water shutoff. Some examples are shown in Table 13-8. The demand reductions are based on \u201ca reasonable probability that there will be a supply shortage\u201d and that the specified reductions are required to \u201censure that sufficient supplies will be available to meet anticipated demands.\u201d The state of Georgia has a comprehensive drought response plan that is triggered by SPI readings for 3, 6, and 12 months. The plan includes several categories of users includ-ing municipal-industrial, agricultural, and water quality. Specific restrictions are applied for each of four drought levels. For example, in the municipal category, at the lowest level (Level 1), outdoor water use is limited to scheduled weekdays. At the highest level (Level 4), outdoor watering is banned (Georgia EPD, 2003). This is a proactive plan that should be able to prevent severe socioeconomic hardship and water rights lawsuits. In contrast, Tennessee\u2019s drought response plan uses qualitative triggers: \u201cDeteriorat-ing water supplies or quality,\u201d \u201cconflicts among users,\u201d and \u201cvery limited resource avail-ability.\u201d Local actions ar"}

The triggers will be too late to initiate preventive strategies. They are based on \u201chydrologic\u201d drought. In the typical drought sequence, hydrologic drought is in the later stages of drought after meteorological drought and agricultural drought.\nWater Conservation Planning and Implementation.  The status of water conservation \nplanning in the United States has been evaluated for each state. The status is reported in \nfour categories (Rashid et al., 2010):\n 1.

The AMAs include more than 80 percent of Arizona\u2019s population, 50 percent of the total water use, and 70 percent of the state\u2019s groundwater overdraft (Pulwarty et\u00a0al., 2005). Authorized by an act of Congress in 1969 and built by the U.S. Bureau of Recla-mation, the Central Arizona Project (CAP) is the largest single source of renewable water supply in Arizona.

Of the numerous suggestions for water \nconservation presented in Water Conservation for Small- and Medium-Sized Utilities  \n(Green, 2010), two are highlighted here because of the magnitude of their impact on \nwater conservation: leaks and water reuse. Unaccounted for water (UAW) is the term \nused to identify water produced but not otherwise sold. It includes leaks, unauthorized consumption, metering inaccuracies, and data handling errors. It is water that does not produce revenue for the utility. In a 1997 audit, Lebanon, Tennessee, identified 45 percent of their water produc-tion was"}
{"text": " UAW (Leauber, 1997). Water audit and leak detection of 47 California water utilities found an average loss of 10 percent and a range from 5 to 45 percent. It is estimated that up to 700,000 acre-feet of leakage occurs in California each year (DWR, 2010). Community water systems in the United States lose about 6 billion gal-lons of water per day through leaks (Thornton et al., 2008). It is notable that 10 percent of all homes account for 58 percent of household leaks and that households with pools have 55 percent greater leakage than other households (Feldman, 2007). Typically, UAW should not be more than 10 percent of production. Above this level, there is strong incentive to institute a leak detection and repair program. Advances in technology and expertise should make it possible to reduce losses in UAW to less than 10 percent (Georgia EPD, 2007). Aside from the conservation aspect of leak detection and repair, there are other benefits:\n \u2022 Repairing leaks with scheduled maintenance reduces overtime costs of unsched-\nuled repairs.\n \u2022 Leak detection and repair reduces energy consumption and power costs to \ndeliver water.\n \u2022 Leak detection and repair reduces chemical costs to treat water that will not be \ndelivered to customers.\n \u2022 Leak detection and repair reduces potential structural damage to roads.\n \u2022 UAW audits, leak detection and repair have a very favorable return on investment. \u2022 Little leaks get bigger with age . . . and ultimately result in pipe failure.\n Water reus"}

With the \nadvent of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, water power remained important but fossil fuels (primarily coal) began to be used on a large scale. Over the course of the 20th century petroleum products assumed a major role in supplying our energy needs. The United States is both a major producer and major consumer of primary energy in the world. In 2006, the United States produced 21 percent of the world\u2019s primary energy and consumed 26 percent of the world\u2019s primary energy (EIA, 2010a and 2010b).

Or, for that matter, a liter of oil with a liter of natural gas? To make any useful comparison of fossil fuel reserves we must use an energy basis. For fossil fuels, the net heating value (NHV) serves as a common denominator for comparison. Typical values for NHV of some common fuels are shown in Table 13-10. Of course, comparison of energy value is not a comparison of the fuel\u2019s utility. For example, you cannot replace gasoline with the equivalent NHV of coal or natural gas and put it in the gas tank of your car. The fac"}

Because of changes in technology and the change in consumer willingness to pay, the reserve may change even though the mass of fuel does not. The estimated U.S. and world reserves are shown in Table 13-11. How long will the reserves last? Several types of estimates are possible. For example, we can estimate the length of time assuming current consumption rates (demand) with no new discoveries or changes in extraction technology. Alternatively, we can assume some growth in demand with no new discoveries or changes in extraction technology.

During nuclear fission, a neutron penetrates the nucleus of a fissionable atom (a radioactive isotope of uranium or plutonium) and splits it into daughter products while simultaneously releasing energy. To generate energy by fusion, isotopes of a light element such as hydrogen are fused together to form a heavier element such as helium. In this process energy is released. All commercially operating nuclear reactors are based on fission reactions. The two main isotopes of uranium are \n235U and 238U. Of these, about 99.3 percent \nof the naturally occurring uranium is nonfissionable 238U. To induce a sustained fission \nreaction, the probability that excess neutrons from one fission reaction will cause other fissionable atoms to be split is increased by increasing the concentration of fissionable material or by slowing down the neutrons so they are more likely to be captured by \n235U than 238U.\n In the middle of the 20th century, nuclear energy appeared to be a realistic energy alternative to fossil fuel. Many countries began building nuclear reactors. About 440 plants now generate 16 percent of the world\u2019s electric power. Some countries have made nuclear power their primary source of electricity. France, for example, gets 78\u00a0percent of its electricity from fission (Parfit and Leen, 2005).

Recently, well-known environmental advocates have come to regard the very real dangers of nuclear accidents and radioactive waste as less of a threat than the dangers of irreversible climate disruption. They now advocate the advancement of solutions to the economic, safety, waste storage, and proliferation problems because renewable nuclear energy is sustainable while firing fossil fuels is not (Hileman, 2006).\nSustainable Energy Sources\nSustainable energy sources, often called renewables, include hydropower, biomass or biofuels, geothermal, wave, and solar energy.

An alternative source of hydropower is the 70,000 small dams already in existence in the United States. These provide an opportunity to develop so called \u201clow-head\u201d hydropower.

Alkyl esters are used as a diesel blend or substitute that is commonly referred to as biodiesel. In a modern \ndiesel engine it can be blended in any percentage from B1 (1 percent biodiesel and 99 percent petrodiesel) to B99. Because of incentives from Congress, B20 is the popular blend (Pahl, 2005). Biobutanol (1-butanol) is being brought to market as a competitor to ethanol. It \nhas several advantages over ethanol. Ethanol attracts water and tends to corrode nor-mal distribution pipelines. Thus, it must be transported by truck, rail, or barge to termi-nals where it is blended with gasoline. Butanol can be blended at higher concentrations than ethanol without having to retrofit automobile engines. It is also expected to have a better fuel economy than gasoline-ethanol blends (Hess, 2006b). A lesser recognized but age-old source of biofuel is the methane generated from anaerobic decomposition of waste material. In Lansing, MI, for example the methane recovered from a municipal solid waste landfill is used to produce power for more than 4,500 homes each year.

These studies revealed that the corn ethanol en-ergy output:input ratios ranged from 1.25 to 1.34. The ratio for soybean biodiesel was even higher, ranging from 1.93 to 3.67.

Even casual observation of hurricanes and tornadoes reveals that the wind has \npower. Sails and windmills have been used to harness the energy from lesser winds for centuries. The force of the wind on a flat plate held normal to it is expressed as\n F51\n2 Arv2 (13-10)\nwhere F 5 force, N\n A 5 area of plate, m2\n r 5 density of air, kg/m3\n v 5 wind speed, m/s\nIf the force moves the plate through a distance, then work is done.

The first, well noted by sailors in \u201cputting on more sail,\u201d is that the larger the area the greater the force captured. The second is less obvious. That is that the force is proportional to the square of the velocity, and power (kilowatts) is proportional to the cube of velocity (force 3 velocity). It is a characteristic of the wind that the velocity increases with dis-\ntance above ground. Thus, a windmill will be more effective if it is placed at a higher elevation above the ground than a lower one. Modern wind turbines for generation of electrical power are placed on towers ranging from 30 to 200 m in height in \u201cwind farms.\u201d Each wind turbine generates 750 kW to 5 MW. While wind power is environmentally benign, it is not very dependable. Although the noise of 50 or more whirring propellers was initially a major concern in locating wind farms, current designs are quite benign in this respect. It has been forecast that up to 12 percent of the world demand for electricity could be provided by wind in the next two decades. Europe leads the world in wind power with almost 35 GW capacity. Denmark supplies about 20 percent of its electrical needs from wind power (Parfit and Leen, 2005). As of 2009, 34 GW have been installed in the United States. This repre-sented about 3.3 percent of U.S. electric power (EIA, 2010e). In the last decade, the cost of wind power"}

This resource may be captured directly, as is done with greenhouses; passively, for example with thermal masses to absorb solar radiation; or actively, through water heaters, photovoltaic cells, or parabolic mirrors. To be economically realistic, solar energy collection is limited to places with a lot of sunshine; Michigan is not an ideal setting.

The active solar collection systems require large areas of land and \nare very expensive to install. Photovoltaic (PV) systems for generating electricity have been on the market for about 40 years.

In the United States, utility-generated electricity costs about 8.5 cents per kWh so PV systems are not competitive without subsidy. California and New Jersey are leaders in providing subsidies. These include not only cash rebates for installation but also regulatory programs that require utilities to purchase power from the PV users when they cannot use all the electricity they generate (Johnson, 2004). As of 2009, there was about 535 MW of solar capacity in the United States with about 450 MW installed in California (EIA, 2010e). The worldwide growth of PV as an alternative has been over 29 percent per year for the last five years. In Japan, PV has grown at a rate of 43 percent annually since the early 1990s. They plan to have 4.8 GW of capacity installed by 2010.\nHydrogen. A cheap, robust fuel cell is the key to using hydrogen as a fuel. A mem-\nbrane electrode assembly is the heart of the fuel cell (Figure 13-14). The proton-exchange membrane is a barrier to hydrogen but not protons. The membrane allows a catalyst to strip electrons, which power an electric motor, before the hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water. The ultimate source of the hydrogen is water.

Not all of these are practical and some have limited value because of the small segment of the energy demand that they impact. The several examples selected for discussion here were chosen because of their relevance to civil and environmental engineering practice.\nGreen Engineering and Building Construction.  In the United States, buildings \naccount for 42 percent of the energy consumption and 68 percent of the total electricity \nconsumption (Janes, 2010). About 80 percent of this energy consumption is used in residential heating, cooling, and lighting systems. Examples of electricity consump-tion for common household appliances are shown in Table 13-12. Building design teams have become increasingly aware of the need to incorporate green engineering in both new designs and retrofitting old ones. LEEDs and Green Globes provide a methodology for assessing the environmental performance of products selected for construction. Environmental performance is measured in terms of a wide range of potential impacts. Examples include human health respiratory effects, fossil fuel deple-tion, global warming potential, and ozone depletion. Both Green Globes and LEEDs have adopted a form of Life Cycle Assessmen"}

Regular preventive mainte-nance of the HV AC system is essential to conserve energy. Electric motors account for about one-half of the electricity used in the United States (Masters and Ela, 2008). Oversized motors and constant speed motors both contribute to inefficient use of elec-tricity. Out-of-balance fans reduce the efficiency of the HV AC system.

In the United States, transportation ac-\ncounts for 28 percent of energy use (EIA, 2010f). The Corporate Average Fuel Econ-omy (CAFE) standards were first enacted in 1975. The objective of the standards is to increase the motor vehicle fuel efficiency. The standards have been adjusted periodi-cally to increase the miles per gallon (mpg). The standard for cars and light-duty trucks for model year 2011 is 24.1 mpg. The Energy Security Act (EISA) of 2007 requires that new passenger vehicles achieve 35 mpg in 2020. In addition to energy conserva-tion, the achievement of the CAFE standards will result in the reduction of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide emissions. Recycling of asphalt and concrete pavement materials not only saves raw material, it also saves energy. When recycled asphalt pavement is incorporated into new pave-ment, the asphalt cement in the old pavement is reactivated. Recycling in place (RIP) is another energy-saving step in asphaltic pavement rehabilitation. Other materials, including rubber from used tires, glass, and asphaltic roofing, can also be recycled into asphaltic pavement (NAPA, 2010). Concrete pavement is also recyclable.

Energy Conservation in Water and Wastewater Facilities (Schroedel and Cavagnaro, 2010) provides numerous techniques to conserve energy. \nSeveral of these are highlighted in the following paragraphs. Much of the cost for energy is for pumping. Pumps driven by electric motors are often regulated by adjusting valves instead of the speed of the motor itself. The excess electrical energy is wasted as heat. Variable frequency drives (vfd) adjust the speed and thus the pumping rate by adjusting the frequency of the electric current. This is a major means to reduce energy use and cost. Replacement of oversized motors and/or pump impellers is another method to reduce energy inefficiency.

(Note that the computers draw virtu-ally as much power when they are in the \u201csleep mode\u201d as they do when they are active.)\n  Answer: 135 GJ1004  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERINGdav01145_ch"}

This chapter will provide you with tools to do the following:\n \u2022 Determine the radioactivity of a decaying isotope \n \u2022 Determine the holding time to ensure a safe discharge of a liquid radioactive \nmaterial\n \u2022 Estimate the distance to a safety line for a radioactive spill  \u2022 Select a barrier to attenuate a radioactive source\nAtomic Structure*\nWe assume that you are familiar with the Bohr model of atomic structure. In this \nmodel the atom is described as consisting of a central nucleus surrounded by a number of electrons in closed orbits about the nucleus. The orbital electrons are grouped in shells. The nucleus itself can be considered as composed of two distinct kinds of parti-cles: protons, which carry a positive unit charge, e\n1, and neutrons, which are un-\ncharged. In a particular atom there are Z electrons, each carrying a charge e2, orbiting \naround the nucleus, and a nucleus composed of N neutrons and P protons. The condi-\ntion of electrical neutrality for the atom as a whole yields Pe 2 Ze 5 0, that is, the \nnumber of protons in the nucleus is equal to the num"}
{"text": "ber of orbital electrons. The number Z is the atomic charge or atomic number of the atom, and Z 1 N is \nthe atomic mass number, usually denoted by A. The parameters A and Z  completely \ndefine a particular atomic species, this being known as a nuclide. The masses of nuclides are measured in terms of the unified atomic mass unit , \nwith the symbol u. This is defined as the unit of mass equal to one-twelfth the mass of an atom of carbon of atomic mass number 12. This gives 1 u as 1.6606 3 10\n227 kg. On \nthis scale, the mass of the neutron is 1.0088665 u, the mass of the proton 1.0088925 u, and the mass of the electron 0.0005486 u. From the definition of the mass scale, giving proton and neutron masses of the order unity, it is clear that the atomic mass number will be a whole number approxima-\ntion to the nuclidic mass in u. For example, a nuclide of magnesium that contains 12 protons and 12 neutrons has A 5 24 and a nuclidic mass of 23.985045 u. The  difference \nbetween the nuclidic mass and the atomic mass number is called the mass excess. The chemical properties of the atom, and hence its designation as a particular ele-ment, depend on the number of orbital electrons, that is, on the atomic number Z. \nGiven Z, the element is uniquely defined. As an example, if a given atom has two or-\nbital electrons, it must be helium (assuming that the atom is not ionized or in some similar nonequilibrium state). Similarly an atom with eight electrons must be oxygen.\n*This discussion follo"}

But as Z  determines the element, Z  and X  denote the same thing. Thus, the \nshorthand can be amended to AX. For example, carbon has six neutrons and six pro-\ntons. Therefore, this nuclide can be written 12C, or carbon-12.\n For each element (determined only by Z ) several nuclides (determined by Z  and \nA) have the same Z  value but different values of A. These different nuclides of the \nsame element are called isotopes. Hydrogen with Z 5 1 has three isotopes with atomic \nmass numbers of 1, 2, and 3. As Z must remain constant at 1, this means that they have \nzero, one, and two neutrons, respectively. This is illustrated in Figure 14-1. These isotopes \nall act chemically as hydrogen, but their nuclidic masses are different. The nuclidic mass of \n1H is 1.007825 u, that of 2H (known as deuterium) is 2.014102 u, and that of \n3H (known as tritium) is 3.016049 u.\n The atomic weight of an element is defined as the combined nuclidic masses of all the isotopes, weighted according to their natural relative abundances. It is denoted by A. \nIn the case of hydrogen it follows that the atomic "}

For example, the nuclidic mass of \n1H plus a neutron is 2.016490 u, whereas \nthe mass of deuterium is 2.014102 u. This difference of 0.002388 u is called the mass \ndefect. This is because when a proton and a neutron are brought together to form a deuteron (the nucleus of deuterium), energy is released to bind them together. Con-versely, energy must be supplied to split them apart. This required energy, the binding \nenergy, is obtained from Einstein\u2019s equation for the conversion of mass into energy,\n E5\u00a2mc\n2 (14-1)\nwhere Dm is the mass defect and c is the speed of light.\n All energies of emitted radiation and particles, as well as the various atomic and nuclear energy levels, are quoted in terms of the electron volt, eV . This is the energy that would be acquired by an electron in falling through a potential difference of one volt. From this definition the following equivalent units of energy can be established:\n1 eV 51.602 310\n212 erg51.602 310219 J\n For nuclear energy levels and radiation energies, the electron volt is usually an in-conveniently small unit.

In \nother words, this means that if an electron of mass 0.0005486 u were completely an-\nnihilated, the energy released would be approximately 0.511 MeV .\nRadioactivity and Radiation\nBy definition, isotopes have different ratios of neutrons to protons in the nucleus. Some ratios give rise to unstable conditions. This is usually because the neutron- to-proton ratio is too large. Because of this instability, the nucleus changes its state to attain equilibrium, and in so doing emits either a particle or electromagnetic ra-diation to carry off the excess energy. This phenomenon of nuclear disintegration is known as radioactivity, and an isotope that displays such activity is known as a radioisotope. There are three types of isotopes. Some are stable, others are naturally radioactive, and the third group can be artificially produced and are also radioactive. These artifi-cially produced radioisotopes are the isotopes most used in industrial application. Three major types"}

Conceptually, the source of the instability of the heavy \nelements is their size; their nuclei are too large. How can they become smaller? One \nmethod would be to eject protons or neutrons. Rather than doing this singly, the heavy-element atoms expel them in \u201cpackages\u201d containing two protons and two neutrons. This \u201cpackage\u201d is called an alpha particle ( a). An alpha particle is equivalent to the \nnucleus of the helium-4 atom, that is, it is simply a body consisting of two protons and two neutrons bound together. Consequently, if an alpha particle is emitted, the nucleus must change to one that has a charge 2 e less and a mass approximately 4 u less. The \ngeneral expression is\n \nA\nZXLA24\nZ22X142He (14-2)\n Atoms that eject the helium \u201cpackage\u201d are said to decay through emission of \nalpha radiation. Alpha-particle emission occurs mainly in radioisotopes whose atomic number is greater than 82. With increasing atomic number, the occurrence of alpha-particle decay increases rapidly, and it is a characteristic of the very heavy elements. It is particularly in evidence in the main decay chains of the natural radio-active isotopes. You should note that an atom undergoing alpha-particle decay changes into a new element. It is a new element because the product nucleus (often called a daughter) \ncontains two fewer protons than the pa"}

The instability that is the cause of beta-particle emission \narises from the fact that the neutron-to-proton ratio in the nucleus is too high (there are too many neutrons in the nucleus). To achieve stability, a neutron in the nucleus can decay into a proton and an electron. The proton remains in the nucleus so that the dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-4  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-4  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesIONIZING RADIATION   14-5\n neutron-to-proton ratio is decreased, and the electron is ejected.

The general expression for the decay is\n A\nZXLA\nZ11X1b2 (14-3)\nNote that we use the b2 to represent an electron of nuclear origin to differentiate it \nfrom electrons from other sources. The negative sign is used with the b if there is any \nchance of ambiguity, because a similar particle, called a positron, also exists that car-\nries a positive charge. Again, as in alpha radiation, emission of a beta particle changes the parent atom into a new element because the number of protons in the nucleus increases by one. If the daughter product also is radioactive, it will, in turn, emit a beta particle, becoming another new elem"}

Through such a series of changes, for example, the fission-product element krypton becomes rubidium which, in turn, becomes strontium, which finally converts to stable yttrium.\nExample 14-1.  Identify the particles that are emitted in each step of the decay chain \nrepresented by\n3689KrS3789RbS3889SrS3989Y\nSolution.  Because z increases by 1 in each case, the particle emitted in each step is \na beta particle.\nGamma-Ray Emission.   Either alpha or beta particles may be accompanied by gamma \nradiation. Whereas alpha or beta radiation brings about a change in the size of the nu-\ncleus or the number of a particular type of particle therein, the emission of gamma radia-tion represents only a release of energy. This is the energy that remains in the newly formed nucleus after emission of the alpha or beta particle. Electromagnetic radiation in the form of gamma rays is emitted when a nucleus in an excited state transfers to a more stable state. The nucleus thus retains its original composition, the excess energy being radiated away. If the frequency of the radiation is v , and the nucleus changes from a state \nof energy E\n1 to a state of energy E 2, then the two energies are related by the equation\n E12E25hv (14-4)\nwhere h is Planck\u2019s constant, having a value of 6.624 3 10227 ergs. The energy of the \nemitted gamma ray is thus hv. In equations, the gamma ray is represented by the Greek \nletter gamma (g).\nX-Ray"}
{"text": "s.  Gamma rays are similar to x-rays. Their difference lies only in their source. \nGamma rays originate from a nucleus transferring from one nuclear excited state to an-other, whereas x-rays originate from electrons transferring from a higher to a lower atomic energy state. As atomic energy levels are in general spaced much closer in terms of energy than nuclear levels, it follows from Equation 14-4 that the frequencies of x-rays are much less than those of gamma rays. As far as industrial applications are con-cerned, the only difference between them is the penetrating power. Because penetrating power increases with frequency, gamma rays have more penetrating power than x-rays.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-5  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-5  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles14-6  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nMultiple Emissions.   In the preceding discussions, only single emission has been \nconsidered. In practice, two or more different types of emission are possible, and in a \ngreat many cases several particles of the same type but of different energies are emit-ted. This latter effect is due to the multiplicity of nuclear energy levels both in the original isotope nucleus and in the nucleus formed by particle emission.\nRadioactive Decay\nEach unstable (radioactive) atom will eventually achieve stabil"}
{"text": "ity by ejecting an alpha or beta particle. This shift to a more stable form is called decay. Each radioactive decay process is characterized by the fact that only a fraction of the unstable nuclei in a given sample will decay in a given time. The probability that a particular nucleus in the sample will decay during a time interval dt is l dt, where l  is the radioactive decay constant. It \nis defined as the probability that any particular nucleus will disintegrate in unit time. For a large number of like nuclei together, we make the assumption that l  is inde-\npendent of the age of a nucleus and is the same for all nuclei. This means that l is a \nconstant. If N  is the number of nuclei present at a time t, then the number of decays \noccurring in a time dt can be written l Ndt. As the number of nuclei decreases by dN in \nthis time, we can write\n dN52lNdt  (14-5)\nThe negative sign denotes that N is decreasing with time. Equation 14-5 shows that the rate \nof decay is proportional to the number of nuclei present, that is, it is a first-order reaction.\n Equation 11-5 can be rearranged and integrated.\n#N\nN0 dN\nN5#1\n0l dt\nln N\nN052lt\nor\n N5N0 exp( 2lt) (14-6)\nwhere N0 is the number of radioactive nuclei present at time t 5 0.

In the process of decay, a new nuclide is formed, \nthe daughter product. If the daughter product is stable, its concentration will gradually increase as the parent decays. On the other hand, if the daughter product is itself radio-active, the variation in concentrations of parent, daughter, and granddaughter products will very much depend on the relative rates of decay. In several cases a radioactive isotope decays into another nuclide that is itself ra-dioactive. This can continue for a large number of nuclides, resulting in a decay chain. The characteristics of any particular chain depend largely on the relative decay con-stants of its various members. The simplest case is the growth of a radioactive daughter product from the parent atoms. Let us assume we begin with N\n1 parent atoms of decay constant l 1, and N 2 \ndaughter atoms of decay constant l 2. The rate at which the daughter product is increas-\ning is then the difference between the rate at which it is produced by its parent and the rate at which it decays.

Most of the 50 naturally occurring radioiso-\ntopes are associated with three distinct series: the thorium series, the uranium series, and the actinium series. Each one of these series starts with an element of high atomic mass  (uranium-238, thorium-232, and uranium-235, respectively*) and then decays by a long series of alpha- and beta-particle emissions to reach a stable nuclide (lead-206, lead-208, and lead-207, respectively). The three chains are associated with the heavy elements, and very few naturally occurring radioisotopes are found with atomic masses less than 82. The half-lives of the naturally occurring radioisotopes are very long. Presumably they were constituents of the earth at its formation and their activity has not yet died away beyond detection. Two other important isotopes that occur in the natural environment but that are not strictly naturally occurring are hydrogen-3 (tritium) and carbon-14. These radioisotopes are artificially produced by cosmic rays bombarding the upper atmosphere of the earth. At present the quantities of these isotopes are in equilibrium, their production rate by cosmic radiation being balanced by their natural decay rate. Because of this phenom-enon these isotopes are of particular use in archaeological dating.\nArtificially Produced Radioisotopes.   "}
{"text": "The artificial production of radioisotopes is \nmainly carried out either by nuclear reactors or by particle accelerators. The cyclotron \nis the accelerator in most general use because the required bombarding particle ener-gies are easily obtained and the output is reasonably high. The transmutation of a sta-ble isotope to a radioactive one is effected by bombarding a target nucleus with a suitable projectile, either electromagnetic or a particle, to produce the required isotope from the resultant nuclear reaction. When an accelerator is used, the bombarding particles are usually protons, deuter-ons, or alpha particles. In the nuclear reaction brought about by the bombardment of zinc-64 with energetic deuterons from a cyclotron, the deuteron and zinc-64 nucleus combine to form a new element. The new element has a charge of 30e  1 e and an \natomic mass number of 64 1 2. This compound nucleus is then \n66Ga,  gallium-66. \nThis intermediate nucleus disintegrates almost immediately by one of several possible modes of decay. If a proton is emitted, for example, the final nucleus must be left with a nuclear charge of 32 e and an atomic mass number of 65, so it is \n65Zn. This isotope \ndoes not occur in nature. For the production of radioisotopes for industrial application, the most common nu-clear reactions used are those from thermal neutrons. A target sample, in a suitable con-tainer, is inserted into the core of a reactor and left there for varying amounts of time. In the core of a"}
{"text": " reactor there is a copious supply of thermal neutrons. These interact with the target nucleus to produce the required radioisotope, a process known as neutron activation.\nFission\nA nuclear reactor is an assembly of fissionable material (such as uranium-235, pluto-\nnium-239, or uranium-233) arranged in such a way that a self-sustaining chain reaction  \n*actinouranium (uranium-235) is the parent.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-10  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-10  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesIONIZING RADIATION   14-11\nis maintained. When these nuclei are bombarded with neutrons of the appropriate en-\nergy, they split up, or fission, into fission fragments and neutrons. For the nuclear reac-tion to continue, at least one of the neutrons produced must be available to produce another fission instead of escaping from the assembly or being used up in some other nuclear reaction. Thus, there is a minimum ( critical) mass below which the reaction \ncannot be self-sustaining. Actual reactors are built with an excess mass to make large amounts of neutrons available. The excess neutron production is controlled by the use of moderators. The moderators are made of materials with large neutron-capture cross \nsections, such as boron, cadmium, or hafnium. These are formed into control rods that are moved in and out of the reac"}
{"text": "tor to moderate the excess neutrons. The fission chain reaction is characterized by an enormous release of heat. This heat must be carried away by an efficient cooling system to prevent mechanical failure of the reactor assembly (meltdown) and, ultimately, an uncontrolled fission. The ulti-mate uncontrolled reaction is, of course, an atomic explosion. The fission fragments are simply lower mass elements. There are, most commonly, two fission fragments from each nucleus with an energy of the order of 200 MeV shared between them. The uranium nucleus does not split into the same two fragments each time. The breakup is far from symmetrical and can occur in more than 30 different ways. The most commonly produced isotopes are grouped around the mass numbers 95 and 139. The fragments produced from the fission process have very large neutron-to-proton ratios so that they are highly unstable. Many transitions have to occur before a stable nucleus is finally achieved. These successive decays give rise to a decay chain. Fission fragments, because of their high mass and very high initial charge, have extremely short ranges in matter. Hence, they are contained within the fuel element when a uranium nucleus fissions. The spent nuclear reactor fuel elements thus provide a very intense radioactive source that presents many problems in the subsequent han-dling and processing. Fission fragments themselves can sometimes be used as a radio-active source for industrial application.\nThe Production"}
{"text": " of X-Rays*\nX-rays were discovered in 1895 by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen. During the course of some studies, he covered a cathode ray tube with a black cardboard box and  observed fluorescence on a screen coated with barium platinocyanide near the tube. After fur-ther investigation of this phenomenon, he concluded that the effect was caused by the generation of new invisible rays capable of penetrating opaque materials and producing visible fluorescence in certain chemicals. He called these new invisible rays x-rays. Because of their discoverer, x-rays are also sometimes referred to as \nRoentgen rays. As pointed out previously, x-rays are electromagnetic waves and occupy the same portion of the electromagnetic spectrum as gamma rays. Like gamma rays, x-rays can pass through solid material. The mode of interaction of x-rays with matter is the same, as are the biological and photographic effects.\n*This discussion follows U.S. PHS, 1968.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-11  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-11  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles14-12  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n Whereas gamma rays come from within the nucleus of the atom, x-rays are gener-\nated outside the nucleus by the interaction of high-speed electrons with the atom.

{"text": "gamma rays. Gamma rays from any single radionuclide consist only of rays of one or several dis-crete energies. X-rays consist of a broad, continuous spectrum of energies. The con-tinuous spectrum will be discussed in detail later.\nThe X-Ray Tube.  X-rays are produced whenever a stream of high-speed electrons \nstrikes a substance. This is caused by their sudden stoppage or deflection by atoms within the target material. The x-ray tube (Figure 14-2) is designed to provide the high-speed electrons and the interacting material. Essential components of a x-ray tube are (1) a highly evacuated glass envelope containing the cathode and anode; (2) a source of electrons proceeding from a cathode; and (3) a target (or anode) placed in the path of the electron stream. The development of the hot filament tube by William D. Coolidge in 1913 was a major advance. Most x-ray tubes in use today are of this type. Here, the free electrons are \u201cboiled out\u201d of an incandescent filament within an evacuated tube and given their velocity by accelerating them through an electric field. In the hot filament tube, the quality and intensity of radiation can be controlled independently by simple electrical means. The intensity of radiation is directly proportional to the current and is proportional to the square of the voltage. This allows a much wider range of wavelengths and intensities, while the characteristics of the tube remain reasonably constant throughout its useful life. The high voltages required"}
{"text": " for x-ray tube operation are best obtained by step-up transformers, whose output is always alternating current. Because the electrons must flow only from cathode to anode within the tube some means of rectification is neces-sary. A self-rectified tube acts as its own rectifier. When an alternating voltage is ap-plied to such a tube, electrons flow only from the cathode to anode as long as the anode remains cool. If the anode becomes hot, the flow of electrons reverses during the second half- cycle and the cathode is damaged.

The use of \u201cvalves\u201d (rectifiers) in the power supply \ncircuit eliminates the inverse voltage on the x-ray tube. Thus, more power can be handled by the x-ray tube, the radiation output is increased, and the time of exposure is shortened.\nX-Ray Production Efficiency.  On average, the fraction of the electron energy emit-\nted as electromagnetic radiation increases with the "}
{"text": "atomic number of the atoms of the target and the velocity of the electrons. This fraction is very small and can be repre-sented by the following empirical equation:\n F51.1310\n29 ZV (14-20)\nwhere  F 5 fraction of the energy of the electrons converted into x-rays\n Z 5 atomic number of the target\n V 5 energy of the electrons (in volts)*\n Typically, less than 1 percent of the electrical power supplied is converted into x-ray energy. The remaining energy (over 99 percent) appears as heat produced at the target (largely through ionization and excitation). As a result, electron bombardment of the target raises it to a high temperature and, if the heat produced is not dissipated fast enough, the target will melt. This heat production is a serious factor in limiting the capacity of a x-ray tube. A suitable target must have the following characteristics:\n 1. A high atomic number because efficiency is directly proportional to Z\n 2. A high melting point because of the high temperatures involved 3. A high thermal conductivity to dissipate the heat 4. Low vapor pressure at high temperatures to prevent target evaporation\nThe Continuous Spectrum.  When high-speed electrons are stopped by a target, the \nradiation produced has a continuous distribution of energies (wavelengths). As the fast-moving electrons enter the surface layers of the target, they are abruptly slowed down by collision with the strong Coulomb field of the nucleus and are diverted from their original direction of motion.

{"text": "h time the electron suffers an abrupt change of speed, a change in direction, or both, energy in the form of x-rays is radiated. The energy of the x-ray photon emitted depends on the degree of deceleration. If the electron is brought to rest in a single collision, the energy of the resulting photon corresponds to the kinetic energy of the electron stopped and will be a maximum. If the electron suffers a less drastic collision, a lower energy photon is produced. Because a variety of types of collisions will be occurring, photons of all energies up to the maximum will be pro-duced. This accounts for the continuous distribution of an x-ray spectrum. The maximum intensity (peak of the curve) occurs at a wavelength about 1.5 times the minimum wavelength. The total intensity of radiation from a given x-ray tube is represented by the area under the spectral curve. The intensity has been found, as might be expected, to be directly proportional to the electron current (number of electrons striking the target).\n*The electron energy is generally expressed in terms of the voltage applied across the tube.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-13  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-13  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles14-14  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nRadiation Dose\u2020\nFundamentally, the harmful consequences of ionizing radiati"}

This absorbed energy (or dose) produces chemical decomposition of the molecules present in the living cells. The mechanism of the decomposition appears to be related to ionization and excitation interactions between the radiation and atoms within the tissue. The amount of i  onization or number of ion pairs produced by ionizing radiations in the cells or  tissues provides some measure of the amount of decomposition or physiolog-ical damage that might be expected from a given quantity or dose. The ideal basis for radiation dose measurement could be, therefore, the number of ion pairs (or ioniza-tions) taking place within the medium of interest. For certain practical reasons, the medium chosen for defining exposure dose is air.\nExposure Dose\u2014the Roentgen.  The exposure dose of x- or gamma radiation within \na specific volume is a measure of the radiation based on its ability to produce ionization in air. The unit used for expressing the exposure to x- or gamma radiation is the roent-gen (R). Its merit lies in the fact that the magnitude of the exposure dose in roentgens can usually be related to the absorbed dose, which is of importance in predicting or quantifying the expected biological effect (or injury) resulting from the radiation. The roentgen is an exposure dose of x- or gamma radiation such that the associ-\nated corpuscular emission per 0.001293 g of air* produces, in air, "}

Because the ionizing property of radiation provides the basis for several types of detection instruments and methods, such devices may be used to quantify the exposure dose. Note that this is a unit of exposure dose based on ionization of air; it is not a unit of ionization, nor is it an absorbed dose in air.\nAbsorbed Dose\u2014the Gray.  The absorbed dose of any ionizing radiation is the en-\nergy imparted to matter by ionizing radiations per unit mass of irradiated material at the \nplace of interest. The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray (Gy). One gray is equivalent to \nthe absorption of 1 J/kg (joule per kilogram). The former unit of absorbed dose was the rad. One rad  is equivalent to the absorption of 100 ergs/g. One Gy 5  100 rads. It should \nbe emphasized that although the roentgen unit is strictly applicable only to x- or gamma radiation, the gray may be used regardless of the type of ionizing radiation or the type of absorbing medium. To make a conversion from roentgens to grays two things must be known: the energy of the incident radiation and the mass absorption coefficient of the absorbing material.\nExample 14-3.  A dose of 1.0 R of gamma radiation was measured in air. From em-\npirical studies it is known that, on the average, 34 eV of energy is transferred (or ab-sorbed) in the process of forming each ion pair in air.

Although all ionizing radia-\ntions are capable of producing similar biological effects, the absorbed dose, measured in grays, that will produce a certain effect may vary appreciably from one type of ra-diation to another. The difference in behavior, in this connection, is expressed by means of a quantity called the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the particular radiation. The RBE of a given radiation may be defined as the ratio of the absorbed dose (grays) of gamma radiation (of a specified "}
{"text": "energy) to the absorbed dose of the given \nradiation required to produce the same biological effect. Thus, if an absorbed dose of 0.2 Gy of slow neutron radiation produces the same biological effect as 1 Gy of gamma radiation, the RBE for slow neutrons would be\nRBE 51 Gy\n0.2 Gy55\nThe value of the RBE for a particular type of nuclear radiation depends on several factors, such as the energy of the radiation, the kind and degree of the biological damage, and the nature of the organisms or tissue under consideration.\nTissue Weighting Factor (W\nT).  The tissue weighting factor ( WT) is a modifying \nfactor used in dose calculations to correct for the fact that different tissues and organs \nhave varying degrees of radiosensitivity depending on the radioisotope and the chemical form of the radioisotope. Some tissues and organs are very sensitive; others are not radiosensitive at all. For example, because iodine is easily incorporated in thyroid tissue, the thyroid gland is very sensitive to the radioiodines. The W\nT is, therefore, \nhigh for the radioiodines. When the tissue or organ is not radiosensitive, the value of W\nT may be very small or zero for that tissue.\nThe Sievert.  With the concept of the RBE in mind, it is now useful to introduce an-other SI unit, known as the sievert (Sv). One sievert equals the radiation dose having \nthe same biological effect as a gray of gamma radiation. This was formerly know as the rem, an abbreviation of \u201croentgen equivalent man\u201d (1 Sv 5 100 rem)"}

The first case of human injury was reported in the literature just a few months following Roentgen\u2019s original paper in 1895 announcing the discovery of x-rays. As early as 1902, the first case of x-ray induced cancer was reported in the literature. Early human evidence for harmful effects as a result of exposure to radiation in large amounts existed in the 1920s and 1930s based on the experience of early radiolo-gists, persons working in the radium industry, and other special occupational groups. The long-term biological significance of smaller, chronic doses of radiation, however, was not widely appreciated"}
{"text": " until the 1950s, and most of our current knowledge of the biological effects of radiation has been accumulated since World War II.\nSequential Pattern of Biological Effects\nThe sequence of events following radiation exposure may be classified into three peri-ods: a latent period, a period of demonstrable effect, and a recovery period.\nLatent Period.  Following the initial radiation event, and often before the first de-\ntectable effect occurs, there is a time lag referred to as the latent period. There is a vast time range possible in the latent period. In fact, the biological effects of radiation are arbitrarily divided into short-term, or acute, and long-term, or delayed, effects on this basis. Those effects that appear within a matter of minutes, days, or weeks are called acute effects and those that appear years, decades, and sometimes generations later are \ncalled delayed effects.\nDemonstrable Effects Period.   During or immediately following the latent period, \ncertain discrete effects can be observed. One of the phenomena seen most frequently \nin growing tissues exposed to radiation is the cessation of mitosis or cell division. This may be temporary or permanent, depending on the radiation dosage. Other effects observed are chromosome breaks, clumping of chromatin, formation of giant cells or other abnormal mitoses, increased granularity of cytoplasm, changes in staining char-acteristics, changes in motility or ciliary activity, cytolysis, vacuolization, altered vis-cos"}

Following exposure to radiation, recovery can and does take place \nto a certain extent. This is particularly manifest in the case of the acute effects, that is, those appearing within a matter of days or weeks after exposure. There is, however, a residual damage from which no recovery occurs, and it is this irreparable injury which can give rise to later delayed effects.\nDeterminants of Biological Effects\nThe Dose-Response Curve.  For any biologically harmful agent, it is useful to corre-late the dosage administered with the response or damage produced. \u201cAmount of dam-age\u201d in the case of radiation might be the frequency of a given abnormality in the cells \nof an irradiated animal, or the incidence of some chronic disease in an irradiated hu-man population. In plotting these two variables, a dose-response curve is produced. With radiation, an important question has been the nature and shape of this curv"}
{"text": "e. Two possibilities are illustrated in Figures 14-3 and 14-4. Figure 14-3 is a typical \u201cthreshold\u201d curve. The point at which the curve intersects the abscissa is the threshold dose, that is, the dose below which there is no response. If an acute and easily observable radiation effect, such as reddening of the skin, is taken as \u201cresponse,\u201d then this type of curve is applicable. The first evidence of the effect does not occur until a certain minimum dose is reached. Figure 14-4 represents a linear, or nonthreshold, relationship, in which the curve intersects the abscissa at the origin. Here any dose, no matter how small, involves some degree of response. There is some evidence that the genetic effects of radiation constitute a nonthreshold phenomenon, and one of the underlying (and prudent) as-sumptions in the establishment of radiation protection guidelines and in radiation con-trol activities in public health programs has been the assumption of a nonthreshold effect. Thus, some degree of risk is assumed when large populations of people are ex-posed to even very small amounts of radiation. This assumption often makes the estab-lishment of guidelines for acceptable radiation exposure an enormously complex task, because the concept of \u201cacceptable risk\u201d comes into play, in which the benefit to be accrued from a given radiation exposure must be weighed against its hazard.Threshold\ndose\nDoseResponse\nFIGURE 14-3\nDose-response curve depicting \u201cthreshold\u201d dose.DoseResponse\nFIGURE 14-"}

The rate at which the radiation is administered or absorbed is \nmost important in the determination of what effects will occur. Because a considerable degree of recovery occurs from the radiation damage, a given dose will produce less of an effect if divided (thus allowing time for recovery between dose increments) than if it were given in a single exposure.\nArea Exposed.  Generally when an external radiation exposure is referred to without \nqualification as to the area of the body involved, whole-body irradiation is assumed. The portion of the body irradiated is an important exposure parameter because the larger the area exposed, other factors being equal, the greater the overall damage to the organism. Even partial shielding of the highly radiosensitive blood-forming organs such as the spleen and bone marrow can mitigate the total effect considerably. An ex-ample of this phenomenon is in radiation therapy, in which doses that would be lethal if delivered to the whole body are commonly delivered to very limited areas, such as to tumor sites.\nVariation in Species and Individual Sensitivity.   T"}
{"text": "here is a wide variation in the \nradiosensitivity of various species. Lethal doses for plants and microorganisms, for \nexample, are usually hundreds of times larger than those for mammals. Even among different species of rodents, it is not unusual for one to demonstrate three or four times the sensitivity of another. Within the same species, biological variability accounts for a difference in sensi-tivity among individuals. For this reason the lethal dose for each species is expressed in statistical terms. The LD\n50 for that species, or the dose required to kill 50 percent of \nthe individuals in a large population, is the standard statistical measure. For people, the LD\n50 is estimated to be approximately 450 R.\nVariation in Cell Sensitivity.  Within the same individual, a wide variation in sus-ceptibility to radiation damage exists among different types of cells and tissues. In general, cells that are rapidly dividing or have a potential for rapid division are more sensitive than those that do not divide are. Furthermore, nondifferentiated cells (i.e., primitive, or nonspecialized) are more sensitive than highly specialized cells. Within the same cell families then, the immature forms, which are generally primitive and rapidly dividing, are more radiosensitive than the older, mature cells, which have spe-cialized in structure and function and have ceased to divide.\nAcute Effects\nAn acute dose of radiation is one delivered to a large portion of the body during a very short ti"}

Here the  latent period, or time elapsed between the radiation insult and the onset of effects, is  re  latively short and grows progressively shorter as the dose level is raised. These  short-term radiation ef fects are composed of signs and symptoms collectively known \nas acute radiation syndrome.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-18  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-18  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesIONIZING RADIATION   14-19\n The stages in acute radiation syndrome may be described as follows:\n 1. Prodrome. This is the initial phase of the syndrome and is usually character-\nized by nausea, vomiting, and malaise. It may be considered analogous to the prodrome state in acute viral infections in which the individual is subject to nonspecific systemic reactions.\n 2. Latent stage . During this phase, which may be likened to the incubation pe-\nriod of a viral infection, the subjective symptoms of illness may subside, and the individual may feel well. Changes, however, may be taking place within the blood-forming organs and elsewhere that will subsequently give rise to the next aspect of the syndrome.\n 3. Manifest illness stage. This phase reflects the clinical picture s"}

Among the possible signs and symptoms are fever, infection, hemorrhage, severe diarrhea, prostration, disorientation, and cardiovascular collapse. Which, if any, of the foregoing phenomena are observed in a given individual largely depend on the radiation dose received.\n 4. Recovery or death.\nRelation of Dose to Type of Acute Radiation Syndrome\nAs mentioned earlier, each kind of cell has a different sensitivity to radiation. At rela-tively low doses, for example, the most likely cells to be injured are those with greatest sensitivity, such as the immature white blood cells of lymph nodes and bone marrow. At low doses the observable effects during the manifest illness stage would be in these cells. Thus, you would expect to observe fever, infection, and hemorrhage. This is known as the hematopoietic form of the acute radiation syndrome. At higher doses, usually over 6 Gy cells of somewhat lower sensitivity will be in-jured. Of particular importance are the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract, for \nwhen these are destroyed a vital biological barrier is broken down. As a result, fluid loss may occur, as well as overwhelming infection and severe diarrhea in the gastrointestinal \nform of the acute radiation syndrome. In the cerebral form, which may result from doses of 100 Gy or more, the rela-\ntively resistant cells of the central nervous system are damaged, and the affected indi-vidual undergoes a rapid illness, c"}
{"text": "haracterized by disorientation and shock. Considering the large degree of individual variation that exists in the manifestation of radiation injury, it is difficult to assign a precise dose range to each of these forms of the syndrome. The following generalizations, however, may serve to provide a rough indica-tion of the kinds of doses involved. At 0.5 Gy or less, ordinary laboratory or clinical meth-ods will show no indications of injury. At 1 Gy, most individuals show no symptoms, although a small percentage may show mild blood changes. At 2 Gy, most persons show definite signs of injury; this dose level may prove fatal to those individuals most sensitive to the effects of radiation. At 4.5 Gy, the mean lethal dose has been reached, and 50 per-cent of exposed individuals will succumb. Approximately 6 Gy usually marks the thresh-old of the gastrointestinal form of the acute radiation syndrome, with a very poor prognosis for all individuals involved. A fatal outcome may well be certain at 8\u201310 Gy.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-19  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-19  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles14-20  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nDelayed Effects\nLong-term effects of radiation are those that may manifest themselves years after the \noriginal exposure.

{"text": " associated with acute radiation syndrome. Delayed radiation effects may result from previous acute, high-dose exposures or from chronic, low-level exposures over a period of years. No unique disease is associated with the long-term effects of radiation. These ef-fects manifest themselves in human populations simply as a statistical increase in the incidence of certain already existing conditions. Because of the low incidence of these conditions, it is usually necessary to observe large populations of irradiated persons to measure these effects. Biostatistical and epidemiological methods are then used to in-dicate relationships between exposure and effect. In addition to the large numbers of people needed for human studies of delayed radiation effects, the situation is further complicated by the latent period. In some cases, a radiation-induced increase in a dis-ease may go unrecorded unless the study is continued for many years. Also note that although it is possible to perform true experiments with animal populations, in which all factors with the exception of radiation exposure are kept identical in study populations, human data are limited to \u201csecondhand\u201d information accrued from populations irradiated for reasons other than radiobiological informa-tion. Often a special characteristic of irradiated human populations is the presence of some preexisting disease that makes it extremely difficult to draw meaningful conclu-sions when these groups are compared with nonirradiate"}
{"text": "d ones. Despite these difficulties, many epidemiologic investigations of irradiated human beings have provided convincing evidence that ionizing radiation may indeed result in an increased risk of certain diseases long after the initial exposure. This information supplements and corroborates that gained from animal experimentation that demon-strates these same effects. Among the delayed effects thus far observed have been somatic damage, which may result in an increased incidence of cancer, embryological defects, cataracts,  lifespan shortening, and genetic mutations. With proper selection of animal species and strains, and of dose, ionizing radiation may be shown to exert an almost universal carcinogenic action, resulting in tumors in a great variety of organs and tissues. There is human evidence as well that radiation may contribute to the induction of various kinds of neoplastic diseases (cancers).\nHuman Evidence.  Both empirical observations and epidemiologic studies of irradi-\nated individuals have more or less consistently demonstrated the carcinogenic proper-ties of radiation. Some of these findings are summarized here. Early in the 1900s, when delayed radiation effects were little recognized, lumi-nous numerals on watches and clocks were painted by hand with fine sable brushes, dipped first in radium-containing paint and then often \u201ctipped\u201d on the lips or tongue. Young women commonly were employed in this occupation. Years later, studies of these  individuals who had "}
{"text": "ingested radium paint have disclosed an increased incidence of bone sarcomas and other malignancies resulting from the burdens of radium that had accumulated in their bones. Some early medical and dental users of x-rays, largely unaware of the hazards in-volved, accumulated considerable doses of radiation. As early as the year 1910, there dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-20  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-20  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesIONIZING RADIATION   14-21\nwere reports of cancer deaths among physicians, presumably attributable to x-ray \nexposure. Skin cancer was a notable finding among these early practitioners. Dentists, for example, developed lesions on the fingers with which they repeatedly held dental films in their patients\u2019 mouths. Early in the 1900s, certain large mines in Europe were worked for pitchblende, a uranium ore. Lung cancer was highly prevalent among the miners as a result of the inhalation of large quantities of airborne radioactive materials. It was estimated that the risk of lung cancer in the pitchblende miners was at least 50 percent higher than that of the general population. One of the strongest supports for the concept that radiation is a leukemogenic agent in people comes from the epidemiologic studies of the survivors of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, Japan. Survivors exposed"}
{"text": " to radiation above an estimated dose of approximately 1 Sv showed a significant increase in the incidence of leuke-mia. In addition, leukemia incidence correlated well with the estimated dose (ex-pressed as distance from the detonation point), thus strengthening the hypothesis that the excess leukemia cases were indeed attributable to the radiation exposure. There is also some indication of an increase in thyroid cancer among the heavily  irradiated survivors. A pioneering study of children of mothers irradiated during pregnancy purported to show an increased risk of leukemia among young children if they had been irradi-ated in utero as a result of pelvic x-ray examination of the mother. Mothers of leuke-mic children were questioned as to their radiation histories during pregnancy with the child in question, and these responses were compared with those of a control group, consisting of mothers of healthy playmates of the leukemic children. Origi-nally this work received much criticism, based partly on the questionnaire technique used to elicit the information concerning radiation history. It was believed that dif-ferences in recall between the two groups of mothers might have biased the results. A larger subsequent study designed to correct for the objections to the first one cor-roborated its essential findings and established the leukemogenic effect on the fetus of prenatal x-rays. Considering the fact that immature, undifferentiated, and rapidly dividing cells are highly "}
{"text": "sensitive to radiation, it is not surprising that embryonic and fetal tissues are readily damaged by relatively low doses of radiation. It has been shown in animal experiments that deleterious effects may be produced with doses of only 0.10 Gy delivered to the embryo. There is no reason to doubt that the human embryo is equally susceptible. The majority of the anomalies produced by prenatal irradiation involve the central nervous system, although the specific type of damage is related to the dose and to the stage of pregnancy during which irradiation takes place. In terms of embryonic death, the very earliest stages of pregnancy, perhaps the first few weeks in human beings, are most radiosensitive. From the standpoint of practical radiation protection, this very early sensitivity is of great significance, because it involves a stage in human embry-onic development in which pregnancy may well be unsuspected. For this reason, the International Committee on Radiological Protection has recommended that routine non-emergency diagnostic irradiation involving the pelvic area of women in the childbearing years be limited to the 10-day interval following the onset of menstruation. Such precau-tions would virtually eliminate the possibility of inadvertently exposing a fertilized egg.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-21  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-21  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolume"}
{"text": "s/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles14-22  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n The period from approximately the second through the sixth week of human ges-\ntation, when pregnancy could still be unsuspected, is the most sensitive for the produc-tion of congenital anomalies in the newborn. During this period, embryonic death is less likely than in the extremely early stage, but the production of morphological de-fects in the newborn is a major consideration. During later stages of pregnancy, embryonic tissue is more resistant to gross and easily observable damage. However, functional changes, particularly those involving the central nervous system, may result from such late exposures. These would be dif-ficult to measure or evaluate at birth. They usually involve subtle alterations in such phenomena as learning patterns and development and may have a considerable latent period before they manifest themselves. There is some evidence that the decreasing sensitivity of the fetus to gross radiation damage as pregnancy progresses may not ap-ply for the leukemogenic effects of prenatal irradiation. Another important factor to be considered in evaluating the radiation hazard during late pregnancy is that irradiation may produce true genetic mutations in the immature germ cells of the fetus for which no threshold dose has been established.\nLifespan Shortening.  In a number of animal experiments, radiation has been dem-\nonstrated to have a lifespan-short"}
{"text": "ening effect. The aging process is complex and largely obscure, and the exact mechanisms involved in aging are as yet uncertain. Irradiated animals in these investigations appear to die of the same diseases as the nonirradiated controls, but they do so at an earlier age. How much of the total effect is due to premature aging and how much to an increased incidence of radiation-induced diseases is still unresolved.\nGenetic Effects\nBackground.  The fertilized egg is a single cell resulting from the union of sperm and egg; millions of cell divisions develop it into a complete new organism. The informa-tion that produces the characteristics of the new individual is carried in the nucleus of the fertilized egg on rod-shaped structures called chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. In each pair, one member is contributed by the mother and the other by the father. With each cell division that the rapidly developing embryonic tissue undergoes, all of this information is faithfully duplicated, so that the nucleus in each new cell of the devel-oping organism contains essentially all of the information. This, of course, includes the germ cells in the new organism, which are destined to become sperm or eggs, and thus the information is transmitted from one generation to the next. This hereditary information is often likened to a template or to a code, which is reproduced millions of times over with remarkable accuracy. It is possible to damage the hereditary material in the cell nucleus by mea"}
{"text": "ns of external influences, and when this is done the garbled or distorted genetic information will be reproduced just as faithfully when the cell divides as was the original message. When this kind of alteration occurs in those cells of the testes or ovaries that will become mature sperm or eggs, it is referred to as genetic mutation; if the damaged sperm or egg cell is then used in conception, the defect is reproduced in all of the cells of the new organism that results from this conception, including those that will become sperm or eggs, and thus whatever defect resulted from the original mutation can be passed on for many generations.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-22  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-22  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesIONIZING RADIATION   14-23\n Most geneticists agree that the great preponderance of genetic mutations are harm-\nful. By virtue of their damaging effects, they can be gradually eliminated from a popu-lation by natural means because individuals afflicted with this damage are themselves less likely to reproduce successfully than are normal individuals. The more severe the defect produced by a given mutation, the more rapidly it will be eliminated and vice versa; mildly damaging mutations may require a great many generations before they gradually disappear. As a balance to this natural "}
{"text": "elimination of harmful mutations, fresh ones are con-stantly occurring. A large number of agents have mutagenic properties, and it is prob-able that our current knowledge includes just a fraction of these. In addition, mutations can arise within the germ cells of an organism without external insult. Among the various external influences found to be mutagenic are a wide variety of chemicals, certain drugs, and physical factors such as elevated temperatures and ionizing radia-tion. Natural background radiation probably accounts for a small proportion of natu-rally occurring mutations. For people, it has been estimated that background radiation \nprobably produces less than 10 percent of these. Anthropogenic radiation, of course, \nif delivered to the gonads, can also produce mutations over and above those that occur spontaneously. Radiation, it should be noted, is not unique in this respect and is probably one of a number of environmental influences capable of increasing the mutation rate.\nAnimal Evidence.  The mutagenic properties of ionizing radiation were first discov-\nered in 1927, using the fruit fly as the experimental animal. Since that time, experi-ments have been extended to include other species, and many investigations have been carried out on mice.

A major human study on genetic effects was made with the \nJapanese who survived the atomic bomb in 1945. As the index of a possible increase of the mutation rate, the sex ratio in the offspring of certain irradiated groups (families, for example, in which the mother had been irradiated but the father had not) was observed. Assuming that some of the mutational damage in the mothers would be re-cessive, lethal, and sex-linked, a shift in the sex ratio among these families might be expected in the direction of fewer male births than in completely nonirradiated groups, and this seemed to be the case in early reports. Later evaluation of more complete data, however, did not bear out the original suggestion of an effect on the sex ratio. The preconception radiation histories of the parents of leukemic children com-pared with those of normal children was a part of the subject of another investigation. From the results, it would appear that there is a statistically significant increase in leu-kemia risk among children whose mothers had received diagnostic x-rays during this dav01145_ch14_001-0"}

The effect here is apparently a genetic rather than an embryonic one because \nthe irradiation occurred prior to the conception of the child. A somewhat similar study ascertained the radiation exposure histories of the par-ents of children with Down syndrome. Most of this exposure was prior to the concep-tion of the child. A significantly greater number of the mothers of children with Down syndrome reported receiving fluoroscopy and x-ray therapy than did mothers of the normal children in the control group. The findings of these two studies may provide evidence that ionizing radiation is a mutational agent in people. However, the findings should be viewed with some res-ervations because there could be significant differences to begin with between popula-tions of people requiring x-rays and those who do not. These differences alone might account for a slightly higher incidence of leukemia or Down syndrome in the offspring of the former group, irrespective of the radiation received. To date, there has been no incontrovertible evidence found of genetic effects in humans from radiation exposure.\n14-3 RADIATION STANDARDS\nTwo population groups are given distinctly different treatment"}
{"text": " in the establishment of exposure\u2014dose guidelines and rules. Standards are set for those occupationally en-gaged in work requiring ionizing radiation and for the general public. Although there are many standard-setting bodies, in general, the limits are consistent between groups. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has published guidelines in the Code of \nFederal Regulations (10 CFR 20) that serve as the standard in the United States. The \ndose guidelines are in addition to the natural background dose. The allowable dose for occupational exposure is predicated on the following assumptions: the exposure group is under surveillance and control; it is adult; it is knowledgeable of its work and the associated risks; its exposure is at work, that is, 40 h/week; and it is in good health. On this basis, no individual is to receive more than 0.05 Sv per year of radiation exposure. For the population at large, the allowable whole body dose in one calendar year is 0.001 Sv. This dose does not include medical and dental doses that, for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons, may far exceed this amount. In addition to these dose rules, the NRC has set standards for the discharge of ra-dionuclides into the environment. Table 14-2 is an extract from that list. These concen-trations are measured above the existing background concentration and are annual averages.

Unlike the standards for exposure and releases to the environment, those for \nradon in indoor air are established by the EPA. This is because radon is not the result of anthropogenic activity but rather occurs naturally. The EPA guidelines suggest that the annual average radon exposure be limited to 4 pCi/L of air.\n14-4 RADIATION EXPOSURE\nExternal and Internal Radiation Hazards\nExternal radiation hazards result from exposure to sources of ionizing radiation of suf-\nficient energy to penetrate the body and cause harm. Generally speaking, it requires an alpha particle of at least 7.5 MeV to penetrate the 0.07 mm protective layer of the skin. A beta particle requires 70 keV to penetrate the same layer (U.S. PHS, 1970). Unless the sources of alpha or beta radiation are quite close to the skin, they pose only a small external radiation hazard. X-rays and gamma rays constitute the most common type of external hazard. When of sufficient energy, both are capable of deep penetration into the body. As a result no radiosensitive organ is beyond the range of their damaging power. Radioactive materials may gain access to the body by ingestion, by inhalation of air containing radioactive materials, by absorption of a solution of radioactive materi-als through the skin, and by absorption of radioactive material into the tissue th"}
{"text": "rough a cut or break in the skin. The danger of ingesting radioactive materials is not neces-sarily from swallowing a large amount at one time, but rather from the accumulation of small amounts on the hands, on cigarettes, on foodstuffs, and other objects that bring the material into the mouth. Any radioactive material that gains entry into the body is an internal hazard. The extent of the hazard depends on the type of radiation emitted, its energy, the physical and biological half-life of the material, and the radiosensitivity of the organ where the isotope localizes. Alpha and beta emitters are the most dangerous radionuclides from the standpoint of internal hazard because their specific ionization is very high. Radio-nuclides with half-lives of intermediate length are the most dangerous because they combine fairly high activity with a half-life sufficiently long to cause considerable damage. Polonium is an example of a potentially very serious internal hazard.

Typical gonadal exposures from natural background are summarized in Figure 14-5. Cosmic radiation is that originating outside of our atmosphere.

Some of the cosmic radia-\ntion penetrates to the earth\u2019s surface and contributes directly to our whole body dose. Terrestrial radiation exposure comes from the 50 naturally occurring radionuclides found in the earth\u2019s crust. Of these, radon has come to have the most significance as a common environmental hazard to the general public. Radon is the product of the radioactive decay of its parent, radium. Radium is produced from each of the three major series: \n235U, 238U, and 232U. The radon iso-\ntopes produced are 222Rn, 220Rn, and 219Rn. These have half-lives of 3.8 days, \n55.6 s, and 3.92 s, respectively. 222Rn, because of its longer half-life and the abun-\ndance of its parent uranium in"}
{"text": " geologic materials, is generally more abundant and, hence, is considered the greater environmental hazard. Because the half-life of ra-dium and its parents is so long, the source is essentially undiminished over human time scales. The hazard of radon does not come from radon itself but from its radioactive decay products (\n218Po, 214Po, 214Bi). The decay products are charged atoms of heavy metals \nthat readily attach themselves to airborne particulates. The main health problem stems from the inhalation of unattached decay products and these particulates. The decay products and particulates become lodged in the lung. As they continue to decay, they release small bursts of energy in the form of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation that dam-age the lung tissue and could ultimately lead to lung cancer (Kuennen and Roth, 1989). Radon is a gas. It is colorless, odorless, and generally chemically inert like other noble gases such as helium, neon, krypton, and argon. It does not sorb, hydrolyze, oxidize, or precipitate. Thus, its movement through the ground is not inhibited by chemical interaction with the soil.0.390.550.532.00 Radon 55%mSv\nMedical 15%\nTotal /H11005 3.60 mSv/yExternal background\nradiation level 15%\nInternal (in the body) 11%\n0.09 mSv Consumer products 3%\n0.04 mSv House construction 1%FIGURE 14-5\nAverage dose per year to person living in the United \nStates.

The rate of dif-fusion or transport is a function of the emanation rate, porosity, structural channels, moisture content, and hydrologic conditions. These migration routes lead to two mech-anisms of effect on people. Buildings constructed in areas of high radon emanation may have radon gas penetrate the structure through natural construction openings such as floor drains or joints (Table 14-3) or through structural failures such as cracks that develop from foundation settlement. In areas where the public water supply is drawn from an aquifer that has radon emanation, shower water may release radon. One rule of thumb is that a radon concentration of 10,000 pCi/L of water, when heated and agi-tated, will produce about 1 pCi/L of air (Murane and Spears, 1987).\nX-Rays\nX-ray machine use is widespread in industry, medicine, and research.

In this use, many individuals besides the patient, including other patients, nurses, technicians, radiologists, and physicians, are potentially exposed to radiation. Static eliminators, employing polonium or radium as the radioactive source, have been widely used in industry. Typical industries where they may be found are the tex-tile and paper trades, printing, photographic processing, and telephone companies.\nArtificially Produced.   Over 6,000 universities, hospitals, and research laboratories \nin the United States are using radionuclides for medical, biological, industrial, agricul-\ntural, and scientific research and for medical diagnosis and therapy. Over a million people in the United States receive radiotherapy treatment each year. Possible exposure from such radionuclides is involved with their preparation, handling, application, and transportation. Exposures, internal and external, might also arise through contamina-tion of the environment by wastes originating from the use of these materials.\nNuclear Reactor Operations\nSources of radiation exposure associated with nuclear reactor operations include the reactor itself; its ventilation and cooling wastes; procedures associated with the re-moval and reprocessing of its \u201cspent\u201d fuel and the resulting fission-product wastes; and procedures associated with the mining, milling, and fabrication of new fuels.\nRadioactive Wastes\nThere are three principal sources of radio"}

Regulations for the handling and disposal of radioactive wastes are designed to minimize exposure to the general public, but the regulations obviously provide less protection to those handling the waste.\n14-5 RADIATION PROTECTION*\nThe principles discussed here are generally applicable to all types or energies of radia-tion. Their application will vary however, depending on the type, intensity, and energy of the source. For example, beta particles from radioactive materials require different shielding from that for high-speed electrons from an accelerator. Ideally, we would like to provide protection that results in a radiation exposure of zero. In actuality, technical and economic limitations force us to compromise so that the risks are small compared with the benefits obtained. The radiation standards set the limit above which the risk is deemed to be too great.\n*This discussion follows U.S. PHS, 1968.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-29  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-29  11/3/11  12:20 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles14-30  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\nReduction of External Radiation Hazards\nThree fundamental methods are employed to reduce external radiation hazards: dis-\ntance, shielding, and reduction of exposure "}
{"text": "time.\nDistance.  Distance is not only very effective, but also in many instances the most \neasily applied principle of radiation protection. Beta particles of a single energy have a finite range in air. Sometimes the distance afforded by the use of remote control han-dling devices will supply complete protection. The inverse square law for reduction of radiation intensity applies for point sources of x-, gamma, and neutron radiation. The inverse square law states that radia-tion intensity from a point varies inversely as the square of the distance from the source.\n I\n1\nI25(R2)2\n(R1)2 (14-22)\nwhere I1 is the radiation intensity at distance R 1 from the source, and I 2 is the radiation \nintensity at distance R 2 from the source. Inspection of this formula will show that in-\ncreasing the distance by a factor of 3, for example, reduces the radiation intensity to \none-ninth of its value. The inverse square law does not apply to extended sources or to radiation fields from multiple sources. X-ray tubes act sufficiently like point sources so that reduction calculations by this law are valid. Gamma ray sources whose dimensions are small in comparison with the distances involved may also be considered point sources, as can capsule neutron sources.\nShielding.  Shielding is one of the most important methods for radiation protection. \nIt is accomplished by placing some absorbing material between the source and the per-son to be protected. Radiation is attenuated in the absorbing medium. "}
{"text": "When so used, \u201cabsorption,\u201d does not imply an occurrence such as a sponge soaking up water, but rather absorption here refers to the process of transferring the energy of the radiation to the atoms of the material through which the radiation passes. X- and gamma ra-diation energy is lost by three methods: photoelectric effect, Compton effect, and pair production. The photoelectric effect is an all-or-none energy loss. The x-ray, or photon, imparts \nall of its energy to an orbital electron of some atom. This photon, because it consisted only of energy in the first place, simply vanishes. The energy is imparted to the orbital electron in the form of kinetic energy of motion, and this greatly increased energy overcomes the attractive force of the nucleus for the electron and causes the electron to fly from its orbit with considerable velocity. Thus, an ion pair results. The high- velocity electron (which is called a photoelectron) has sufficient energy to knock other \nelectrons from the orbits of other atoms, and it goes on its way producing secondary ion pairs until all of its energy is expended. The Compton effect provides a means of partial energy loss for the incoming x- \nor gamma ray. Again the ray appears to interact with an orbital electron of some atom, but in the case of Compton interactions, only a part of the energy is transferred to the electron, and the x- or gamma ray \u201cstaggers on\u201d in a weakened condition.

The unfortunate aspect of Compton interac-tion is that the direction of flight of the weakened x- or gamma ray is different from that of the original. In fact, the weakened x- or gamma ray is frequently referred to as a \u201cscattered\u201d photon, and the entire process is known as Compton scattering. By this mechanism of interaction, the direction of photons in a beam may be randomized, so that scattered radiation may appear around corners and behind shields although at a lesser intensity. Pair production, the third type of interaction, is much rarer than either the pho-toelectric or Compton effect. In fact, pair production is impossible unless the x- or gamma ray possesses at least 1 MeV of energy. (Practically speaking, it does not become important until it possesses 2 MeV of energy.) Pair production may be thought of as the lifting of an electron from a negative to a positive energy state. The pair is a positron\u2013electron pair that results from the photon ejectin"}
{"text": "g an elec-tron and leaving a \u201chole\u201d in the positron. If there is any excess energy in the photon above the 1 MeV required to create two electron masses, it is simply shared be-tween the two electrons as kinetic energy of motion, and they fly out of the atom with great velocity. The negative electron behaves in exactly the ordinary way, producing secondary ion pairs until it loses all of its energy of motion. The posi-tron also produces secondary ionization so long as it is in motion, but when it has lost its energy and slowed almost to a stop, it encounters a free negative electron somewhere in the material. The two are attracted by their opposite charges, and, upon contact, annihilate each other, converting both their masses into pure energy. Thus, two gamma rays of 0.51 MeV arise at the site of the annihilation. The ulti-mate fate of the annihilation gammas is either photoelectric absorption or Compton \nscattering follo wed by photoelectric absorption.\n Because the energy of the photon must be greater than 1 MeV for pair production to occur, this process is not a factor in the absorption of x-rays used in dental and medical radiography. The energies of x-rays used in this type of radiography are rarely more than 0.1 MeV . The predominating mechanism of interaction with the shielding material depends on the energy of the radiation and the absorbing material.

The amount of shielding re-quired is, of course, a function of the particle energy. For example, a 10-MeV al-pha particle has a range of 1.14 m in air, whereas a 1-MeV particle has a range of 2.28 cm. Virtually any solid material of any substance can be used to shield alpha particles. Beta particles can also be shielded relatively easily. For example a \n32P \nbeta at 1.71 MeV can be attenuated 99.8 percent by 0.25 cm of aluminum.

Water, paraffin, and concrete are all rich in \nhydrogen, and thus, important in neutron shielding. Once the neutrons have been re-duced in energy, they may be absorbed by either boron"}
{"text": " or cadmium. When a boron atom captures a neutron, it emits an alpha particle, but because of the extremely short range of alpha particles, no additional hazard results. Neutron capture by cadmium results in the emission of gamma radiation. Lead or a similar gamma absorber must be used as a shield. A complete shield for a capsule-type neutron source may consist of, first, a thick layer of paraffin to slow down the neutrons, then a surrounding layer of cadmium to absorb the slow neutrons, and finally, an outer layer of lead to absorb both the gammas produced in the cadmium and those emanating from the capsule. Some care must be exercised in using shielding to reduce exposure. People outside the \u201cshadow\u201d cast by the shield are not necessarily protected. A wall or partition is not necessarily a safe shield for persons on the other side. Their allowable dose may be less than conceived in the design of the barrier. Radiation can \u201cbounce around corners\u201d be-cause it can be scattered. Scattered radiation is present to some extent whenever an absorbing medium is in the path of radiation. The absorber then acts as a new source of radiation. Frequently, room walls, the floor, and other solid objects are near enough to a source of radiation to make scatter appreciable. When a point source is used under these conditions, the inverse square law is no longer completely valid for computing radiation intensity at a distance. Measure-ment of the radiation is then necessary to determine the pot"}
{"text": "ential exposure at any point.\nReduction of Exposure Time.  By limiting the duration of exposure to all radiation \nsources and by providing ample recuperative time between exposures, the untoward effects of radiation can be minimized. Recognition of the zero threshold theory of damage warrants that exposures, no matter how small, be minimized. The standards established by the NRC are upper bounds to be avoided and not goals to be achieved. In emergency situations it may occasionally be necessary to work in areas of very high dose rates. This can be done with safety by limiting the total exposure time so that the average permissible value for a day based on the radiation protection guide dose of 1 3 10\n23 Gy (0.1 rad) per week is not exceeded. This does not imply that a worker \nshould be allowed to extend this practice beyond receiving 1 3 1023 Gy in a short \nperiod of time, that is, a dose of 1 3 1023 Gy one day and no dose for 6 days would \ncomply with the rule but would be considered excessive. Repetitions of this cycle would be unacceptable. Emergency situations may require that work be done in relays of several people in the same job so that the value of the radiation protection guide is not exceeded by any one person.\nReduction of Internal Radiation Hazards\nOccupational.

The most likely nonoccupational internal radiation hazard is from radon in \nprivate dwellings. Because the radon primarily originates in the soil beneath the house, control efforts are aimed at the basement or crawl space.

The methods to reduce the pathways for entry are summarized in Figure 14-10. Of parti"}

The use of a polyethylene sheet below the slab is particularly effective for controlling leaks that result from slab cracks that develop as the house settles. Because heat in the upper floors tends to rise, creating a draft much like a chimney, the house has a tendency to create a negative pressure on the basement and, hence, \u201csuck in\u201d radon from the soil pore spaces. Figure 14-11 shows some techniques to minimize the draft effect (Murane and Spears, 1987). For existing structures, the remedies are more difficult to install, will be expen-sive, and may not yield satisfactory results. If drain tiles are present around the outside or inside of the perimeter footings, these are ideally located to permit vacuum to be drawn near some of the major soil gas entry routes (the joint between the slab and the foundation wall and the footing region where the radon can enter the voids in the block walls). Other efforts have included drilling holes in the slab itself and creating a vac-uum system beneath the whole slab. Several suction points (three to seven) are re-quired for this technique to work (Henschel and Scott, 1987).

Usage has led us to categorize wastes into \u201clevels.\u201d High-level wastes are those with activities measured in curies per liter; intermediate-level wastes have activities measured in millicuries per liter; low-level wastes have activities measured in micro-curies per liter. Other classifications skip the intermediate-level wastes and use the terms high-level, transuranic, and low-level. The high-level wastes (HLW) are those resulting from reprocessing of spent fuel or the spent fuel itself from nuclear reac-tors. Transuranic wastes are those containing isotopes above uranium in the periodic table. They are the by-products of fuel assembly, weapons fabrication, and repro-cessing. In general their radioactivity is low but they contain long-lived isotopes (those with half-lives greater than 20 years). The bulk of low-level wastes (LLW) has relatively little radioa"}
{"text": "ctivity. Most require little or no shielding and may be han-dled by direct contact.\nManagement of High-Level Radioactive Waste\nIn 2010, there were about 104 operating reactors in the United States (EIA, 2005). Roughly 10 m\n3 of spent fuel is generated annually from each of these reactors. The \nconstruction of the fuel assembly results in considerably less fission product waste. Approximately 0.1 m\n3 of the 10 m3 is fission product waste. Of course, it is evenly \ndistributed throughout the assembly and cannot be easily separated. The management choices are (1) store it indefinitely in the form in which it was removed from the reactor, (2) reprocess it to extract the fission products and recycle the other materials, or (3) dispose of it by burial or other isolation technique. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1987, Congress has prescribed that a stor-age facility be constructed that will not become permanent. President George W. Bush, on July 23, 2002, designated the monitored retrievable storage facility to be sited at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The NRC has detailed the rules for the site in the Code of \nFederal Regulations  (10 CFR 60.113). Some of the important provisions are summa-\nrized here (Murray, 1989).\n 1. The design and operation of the facility should not pose an unreasonable risk to \nthe health and safety of the public.

Three were subsequently closed because they failed. The three sites (Maxey Flats, Kentucky; Sheffield, Illinois; and West Valley, New York) all expe-rienced similar problems. They used shallow land burial to dispose of the waste. This was accomplished by excavating a trench about 3\u20136 m deep and placing the drums and other containers (often cardboard boxes) of radionuclides in the trench and covering them with excavated soil. The completed trench was covered with a mound of earth and seeded. Water seeped through the cover material and animals burrowed through it. The heavy clay sites chosen precisely to limit passage to the groundwater system served as holding ponds for the rainwater and ultimately accelerated the corrosion of the drums. At West Valley, when increased radioactivity called attention to this phenomenon, the trenches were opened and pumped to the nearest stream! Concurrently, it was discov-ered that the drums were often 30\u201350 percent empty. This, combined with the fact that the backfill material was heavy clay that did not completely fill the void spaces between the drums, allowed significant settlement of the cover material. This enhanced the col-lection of precipitation that contributed to the corrosion and failure of the drums. These episodes led to a major rethinking about how"}
{"text": " we should manage our radio-active wastes. One result was that in 1980, Congress enacted the Low-Level Waste Policy Act. It says that each state is responsible for providing for the availability of capacity either within or outside of the state for disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders. The law provided for the formation of compacts between states to allow a regional approach to management. As of March 2004, the compact \norganization was as shown in Figure 14-13. The compacts decide what facilities are required and which states will serve as hosts. Although the compacts were supposed to begin accepting waste in 1986, the negotiation process has taken longer than expected dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-38  11/3/11  12:21 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-38  11/3/11  12:21 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesIONIZING RADIATION   14-39\nand the deadline has been extended to beyond 2010.

It is optimistic to expect much reduction of that volume of waste by sorting out uncontaminated waste unless it is done at the point of origin. Training plant personnel to do this work at the point of origin has been reasonably successful. To ask radioactive waste management personnel to do the sorting of an unknown mixture of wastes at a subsequent time and place creates an unacceptable hazard of ex"}
{"text": "posure to radiation by inhalation, injury, or ambient external exposure. Often material only suspected of being radioactively contaminated is labeled and disposed of as such without necessarily actually being radioactive. Much of the so-called radioactive waste fits into such a category merely because of the place where it was gen-erated. The cost of assaying such suspected low-level solid wastes to determine their true radioactive content is such that it is often cheaper to combine suspected waste with known radioactive waste than to separate it. This suspicious but not always radioactive waste takes up burial space unnecessarily. Time, effort, and money are needlessly ex-pended in putting these nonradioactive wastes in the special radioactive waste landfills. It has been a general practice to assume that all waste is radioactive if it has been generated in a laboratory using radioactive materials or by a radiochemical or similar processing activity. It is termed \u201cradiation zone\u201d or \u201ccontaminated area\u201d wastes. Thus, waste that is suitable for disposal in a municipal landfill is mixed with contaminated waste. The burden of proof that the waste is not radioactive is on the person certifying or releasing the waste. Testing of the waste is time-consuming and is often omitted. Probably the method most likely to succeed in reducing the amount of nonradioac-tive waste is a careful delineation and reduction of the so-called radiation zone and con-tamination areas.

Such areas produce much nonradioactive waste that is often included for conve-\nnience in the low-level solid radioactive waste from the technical areas. In laboratory situations where nonradioactive wastes are generated alongside the radioactive waste, point source segregation can result in minimal radioactive waste generation. Separation of combustible or compactible waste at the point of origin both im-proves waste handling and reduces volume. By sorting, wastes that are not compatible for incineration do not have to be handled at the incinerator. Because the volume re-duction in an incinerator is greater than that in a compactor, the more wastes that are capable of incineration that reach the incinerator rather than the compactor, the greater the volume red"}
{"text": "uction.\nVolume Reduction by Compression.   Compression of solid low-level radioactive \nwaste is suitable for about half the waste generated. There are three kinds of compres-\nsion devices: compactors, balers, and baggers. Compactors force material into the final storage, shipping, or disposal container. A \nfavorite container is the 0.21 m\n3 drum. Some space saving is possible. A variant of the \ncompactor is called the packer. In this device, the material is compressed into a reusable \ncontainer. At the burial grounds, the compacted material is dumped directly without any effort to retain its compacted form. Space saving is minimal with packer systems. Balers compress the waste into bales that are wrapped, tied, or banded and then \nstored, shipped, or disposed of in burial grounds. Considerable space saving is possi-ble with balers. Baggers  compress waste into a predetermined shape that is injected into round or \nrectangular bags, boxes, or drums before storage, shipment, or disposal. Some space saving is possible with this method of compaction. These three techniques may be suited to general and sometimes even to unique situations. Unfortunately, such treatment does not reduce the possibility of burning while in storage, and only certain materials are suitable for compaction. These include paper, cloth, rubber, plastics, wood, glass, and small light metal objects. Large, rigid metal objects must be excluded because they are usually relatively incompressible and can damage th"}
{"text": "e container and compressing machinery. Moisture (free or absorbed in large quantities by blotting paper or rags) has to be avoided because of its potential forcible release under high pressure, creating a great hazard to operators. Obviously, corrosive, pyrophoric, and explosive waste must be excluded from such processing, whether it is organic or inorganic. The compression machinery must be economical, reliable, and easy to operate. Many commercial devices are available, but all must be modified by providing air containment, off-gas ventilation, often filtration, and, if necessary, shielding.\nVolume Reduction by Incineration.   Reduction of volumes of solid radioactive \nwaste by incineration has interested managers of low-level radioactive waste, particu-\nlarly in those parts of the world where land area is at a premium and costs are high.  Under these conditions, the advantages of volume reduction are so great that the draw-backs seem only obstacles to be surmounted. In Europe, where land is scarce and more revered, the incineration of solid combustible radioactive waste is a common and ap-parently satisfactory method of pretreatment before final disposal.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-41  11/3/11  12:21 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-41  11/3/11  12:21 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefiles14-42  INTRODUCTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING\n There a"}

This may be a high estimate if such factors as resi-dues from off-gas treatment and refractory changes are considered. This would represent a considerable saving in land used for burial, in transportation, and in long-term monitoring. In addition, it would free us from the nagging worry about the pos-sible problem of long-burning subterranean fires. Special attention should be given to the problems of burning organic matter (solvents, ion-exchange resins, etc.) and putrescible biological material (animal cadavers, excreta, etc.). Incineration of radio-active waste must be carried out under controlled conditions to prevent the formation of radioactive aerosols and must comply with both RCRA and NRC rules if the wastes are RCRA wastes as well as being radioactive.\nLong-Term Management and Containment\nSite Selection.  One concern in the burial of radioactive waste is that groundwater or infiltrating surface water will leach the waste and mobilize the radioactive materials. The radionuclides would be carried by this water back to the surface as a part of natural groundwater discharge or through a water well. Because of this concern, hydrogeologic and hydrochemical considerations in site selection become paramount. The types of hydrogeologic and hydrochemical data that may be needed to deter-mine whether or not a site is adequate include (Papadopulos and Winograd, 1974):\n 1. "}

It is not possible to immobilize a radioactive contaminant in a burial site for long periods of geologic time (i.e., for millions of years) with complete certainty. However, there appear to be hydrogeologic environments in which these contaminants can be kept below the surface and away from people until they have decayed to acceptable levels. The problem is not merely a matter of ensuring optimum confinement, but also one of ensuring confinement for a minimum but specified time or describing and pre-dicting the performance of these radioactive contaminants in the subsurface until this period has elapsed. For this reason, burial sites having complex hydrogeology in which such predictions are difficult or impossible are probably not suitable for storing rad"}
{"text": "io-active waste. From a geological standpoint, there appear to be two basic approaches to the long-term control of buried radioactive waste. The simplest approach is to prevent water from reaching the waste and thereby to eliminate the possibility of contaminants in the waste being mobilized. In arid climates, where there is little or no infiltration, this ap-pears to be feasible. In humid climates, where there is infiltration, some sort of engineered container or facilities that would isolate the waste from the water for hundreds of years is necessary. Whether or not such a facility can be designed, constructed, and demonstrated remains to be seen. The second approach to long-term control involves burying the waste in a hydro-geologic environment that can be demonstrated to be safe despite the fact that radioac-tive contaminants can and will be mobilized. Demonstrating that such sites are, in fact, safe requires a quantitative evaluation of the factors influencing contaminant move-ment. Such an evaluation may be quite difficult but appears to be our only option if we wish to bury radioactive waste in humid climates or in climates where infiltration is capable of mobilizing or leaching the buried waste. It is also important to give attention to the possible biological and microbiological environment of a burial site.

Some organisms can release organic compounds into the soil that can serve as complexing agents to mobilize otherwise insoluble contaminants. Some organisms can concentrate radionuclides by surprisingly high factors from their environment and so can change both the biochemical availability and the distribution of a radionuclide.\nSite Selection Criteria.  Michigan\u2019s site selection criteria serve to illustrate the fac-\ntors that need to be considered in selecting disposal sites. The first objective is to avoid population centers and conflicts with human activi-ties. Michigan established an isolation distance of 1 km and required that projected population growth must not infringe to the extent that it would interfere with health and safety performance objectives of environmental monitoring. Areas within 1.6 km of a fault where tectonic movement has occurred within the last 10,000 years are excluded as candidate sites. Likewise excluded are areas where significant earthquake intensity has been measured and flood plains exist. Mass wast-ing, erosion, and similar geologic processes are to b"}
{"text": "e evaluated for possible damage to the facility. Areas where groundwater flows from sites more than 30 m in 100 years or where groundwater could reach an aquifer in less than 500 years are excluded. The criteria also exclude areas over sole source aquifers and areas where groundwater discharges to the surface within 1 km. The facility may not be built within 16 km of the Great Lakes. The criteria specify that the safest transportation net will be used. Highways with low accident rates located away from population centers are favored. The site must have no complex meteorological characteristics and must avoid resource development conflicts. Likewise, environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and shorelands must be avoided. Areas that have formally proposed or ap-proved development plans as of January 1, 1988, are excluded. These criteria are extremely rigorous. Because of these constraints and the more serious problem of public opposition, no new sites have been finalized in the United States. Some compacts have had severe problems and conflicts that have resulted in the expulsion of one of the states. For example, after being selected as the host state, Michigan failed to identify an acceptable site and was expelled from the Midwest Compact. A few compacts are proceeding quite well. These compacts are involving the  public, community officials, regulators, and generators in joint efforts to identify sites, complete licensing applications, secure contractors, and constr"}

The three currently operating sites in the United States are at Hanford, Washington; Envirocare in Utah; and Barnwell, South Carolina. These sites are accepting low-level radioactive waste from across the United States. There is a tremendous financial advantage to them in doing so. In 2005, the total cost ranged between $400/ft\n3 for \ncompact members to $1,625/ft3 for noncompact users. Many generators have been stor-\ning this waste for several years (e.g., in Michigan, 55 generators have been storing waste for five years) and they are willing to pay these prices because of the lack of space.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-44  11/3/11  12:21 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-44  11/3/11  12:21 PM user-f462 volumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesvolumes/203/MHDQ302/dav01145_disk1of1/0073401145/dav01145_pagefilesIONIZING RADIATION   14-45\nEngineered Containment Structures.   As mentioned above, in humid climates, land \nburial is not acceptable. Michigan, as an example, has passed a statute that prohibits it. \nThe alternative is an engineered structure. Engineered structures for the containment of waste must be designed with the intent to keep water, which can mobilize the contami-nants, out of the facility. The Michigan statute specifies that each technology considered fulfills three requirements:"}
{"text": "\n 1. Maximum containment until the waste naturally decays to nonhazardous levels;\n 2. Capability to identify and retrieve wastes if necessary; and 3. Comprehensive monitoring of the facility and its environment.\n There are four conceptual designs being considered by the Midwest Compact that \nwould typify the various possible approaches. They are (1) aboveground vault, (2) below-ground vault, (3) aboveground modular concrete canister, and (4) belowground concrete canister. An aboveground vault is a large, reinforced concrete structure with access through the top or side walls for placing the waste inside (Figure 14-15). When a cell is filled, the vault will be sealed with a roof of concrete or some other suitable material. It must be designed to withstand earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, and fire. The belowground vault is similar to the aboveground vault except that it is located below ground (Figure 14-16). A compacted clay cover serves as part of the seal. The aboveground concrete canister method consists of placing the low-level radio-active waste in large, precast concrete containers that are then stacked in an engineered structure (Figure 14-17). The belowground concrete canister method follows the same principles as the aboveground system, but the canisters are placed in a vault below ground (Figure 14-18).FIGURE 14-15\nAboveground vault for low-level radioactive waste disposal/storage.dav01145_ch14_001-052.indd Page 14-45  11/3/11  12:21 PM user-f462dav01145_ch14_001-052."}

A monitoring system must operate both at permanent burial \nsites and at storage sites so that surface or air contamination will be detected quickly. Ground and surface water beneath or very near to the burial facilities should be moni-tored sufficiently often to give the earliest practical warning of failure of any facilities. \u201cFailure\u201d is defined as significant contamination of the ground or surface water in ex-cess of standards that have been set for the disposal site. Early detection of contamination is most important. Unlike surface water, ground-water usually moves slowly, and if contaminants move unexpectedly, we must know about it before significant amounts have left the disposal site.

{"text": "ed in \nselection of the site or the design of facilities. Should it be necessary to take remedial measures to eliminate further discharges, the smaller the amount of waste involved, the simpler these measures are likely to be. Early detection of contaminants generally requires that monitoring points be placed as close as possible to the waste. Air monitoring should be provided around the site. Likewise, monitoring should also include adequate biological and ecological sampling to detect entrance of radio-nuclides into the local biosphere.\nContingency Plan.  Contingency plans must be made to cover all foreseeable acci-\ndents or failures. They must include plans for corrective action in the event that moni-toring shows a hazardous spread of contamination. These plans should include natural disaster precautions as well as more chronic types of failures.\nRecords Management.   Duplicate records of the types, quantities, and concentra-\ntions of radioactive waste nuclides delivered to a burial site must be made and filed \nwith more than one record bank. Reports on monitoring results and significant inci-dents, such as spills or unanticipated release of waste, must be filed with more than one record bank. These records should show the real (that is, observed, not calculated) level of contamination of the environment (including the ground area). These records must be in such a form that they will be useful and available for the effective length of time that the waste burial facility w"}

As a corollary to this recommendation, radioactive waste should not be exhumed and put into temporary engineered storage where the material must await a  final decision on permanent disposal. Experience has shown that \u201ctemporary\u201d storage may in reality be permanent storage because of the political realities in being able to relocate it.\n14-7  CHAPTER REVIEW\nWhen you have completed studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following without the aid of your textbook or notes:\n 1.
